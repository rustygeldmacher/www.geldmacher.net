Last night I added a [gallery of my pictures from China](http://www.flickr.com/photos/geldmacher/sets/72157594570569256/), 56 photos in all. Here is just a small sample.

Jack and I right before sitting down for dinner. That is only about half of the food we ended up with at this feast!

A view across the Haungpu River at night. Here you can see the [Oriental Pearl Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Pearl_Tower) all lit up.

The complete gallery is [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/geldmacher/sets/72157594570569256/). I guess that will wrap up the reporting on my trip. I've had fun telling the stories of my travels on this site. In case you missed anything, here is a re-cap of the story:
