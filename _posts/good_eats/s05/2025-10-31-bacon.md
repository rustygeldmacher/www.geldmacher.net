Creating {% good_eats_recipe_link Scrap Iron Chef's Bacon %} is more of a _project_ than a
recipe, and I've been looking forward to this one. The prospect of making my own bacon,
completely from scratch, has always interested me.

It started with the pork belly. I was able to find a 3.5lb one in the freezer at my local
butcher, so I thawed that out, and cut it down to 2.5lb for ease of recipe adaptation.
I then rubbed it with coarse ground black pepper:

And then popped it into a container with the cooled curing liquid:

I weighed down the pork with some [pickle pepples](https://www.masontops.com/products/pickle-pebbles-plus?srsltid=AfmBOorxXBcVvjho8UGqTpFuwIM5PWWcWdvakNJmEF7YSdoh6HrNf19a)
that we had, and that worked well for keeping it submerged in the cure for the next three days.

After three days, it was go time. I pulled the pork belly out of the cure and put it on a
sheet pan with a rack, in front of a fan, for a little over an hour to develop a nice
pellicle on top.

After that, it was time to get it smoking. For cold smoking, I used a setup that I've been
successful with in the past for making smoked cheese. Rather than rigging up a hot zone/cold
zone smoker like AB does in the episode, I used a [smoke tube](https://a.co/d/8SgMBVr) together
with some apple wood smoking pellets, right on my regular grill with the burners off.

After smoking for about 6 hours (I needed to refill the tube twice), I pulled the pork belly,
or should I say the bacon.

After pulling from the "smoker" I vacuum sealed the whole thing and put it in the fridge
for a few days. The recipe doesn't say to do this, but when I do smoked cheese I let it
rest for a while to let the smoke "sink in". Figured it wouldn't hurt with the bacon.

A couple days later, I borrowed a friend's deli slicer to get to work. First, though, I
put the whole belly into the freezer for about an hour to help with the cutting. After that,
it was slicing time.

![on the slicer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczMhK5V8rELGh8lU5XdBdOGhXNvuj0OLFBl40GsmwGRXoXqJg4NfGd1i78WGdBtihaTS_13_Ndpz3rUU9quoacewPI6yum7c7L-y64v5vZeT_iFXz-yt5R3FmGN2uEA3Qsn6tXxrqnbeL48Hzsuu3dS2=w2298-h1724-s-no-gm?w=500)

Since the slicer can fit ~8 inches left to right, I had to slice the short way a bit,
leaving me with a few shorter pieces, but then I was able to get a whole bunch of normal
long cuts. I also ended up with a chunk of bacon ends, which I'll eventually render down
to use for making clam chowder.

Finally, I divided up the cut bacon into vacuum-sealed packages about about 6oz each.

I froze most of it, but left two packs out -- one to cook, and the other to give to Stan,
who lent me the slicer.

At last came time to cook the bacon. I used my regular technique, which is similar to the one
AB uses on the show -- I lay the strips out on a sheet pan and pop it into a cold oven that I
then set to 350. It takes 25-30m and the bacon comes out crispy and crunchy, just the way we
like it.
