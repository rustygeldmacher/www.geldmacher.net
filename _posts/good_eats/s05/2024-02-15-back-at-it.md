After a long hiatus, I'm back at it on the Good Eats project.

The project has been on hold while we moved and other projects have taken precedence as
we've settled into the new place.

When I finally got the time and attention to return to cooking Good Eats, I decided that
Tuesday's snow day would be a good chance for use to try some
{% good_eats_recipe_link Stove Top Mac-n-Cheese %} for lunch.

The family thought it was delicious, even Vivian who claims not to like mac & cheese
gobbled it up. One point they made was that it tasted a little "too cheddary" -- this
is probably due to the sharp cheddar I used. Maybe next time I'll try a less sharp
cheddar. One thing to note about this mac & cheese -- it's _very_ calorie dense at
65 calories _per ounce_. The recipe makes 40 ounces, so assuming even 5 servings means
we're looking at more than 500 calories per serving.

Then on Wednesday night, I made {% good_eats_recipe_link Panna Cotta Brain with Cranberry Glaze %}
as a special Valentine's Day dessert. Only, in my version I left out the brain and used
ramekins instead.

I made a half-batch, and since some of the amounts in the original recipe are weird
to half (since they're used in various places) here are the proportions I used for
the panna cotta itself:

* 18oz evaporated milk (1.5 cans) -- use half a can to bloom gelatin
* 2 packs of gelatin (I used Gelatine brand)
* 3/4 Cup heavy cream
* 6 Tablespoons of sugar
* Half of a vanilla bean, split
* 0.5 teaspoon salt

I served it by inverting it onto a plate, covering with chocolate sauce, and topping
with whipped cream.

Everyone loved it. It kind of tastes like a cross between ice cream and Jello. It's a
super easy dessert that's also very rich and elegant.

By the way, I did make the cranberry glaze, but it never really set up before it was time
to eat. We did try it on the panna cotta though, and it's a _really_ good combination --
the tartness is a great contrast with the sweetness/richness of the pudding. Perhaps next
time I'll make the cranberry way earlier and let it hang at room temp to set.
