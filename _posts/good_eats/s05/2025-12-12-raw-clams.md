Figured I'd go buy some fresh littlenecks this afternoon to have a bit of an appetizer
of {% good_eats_recipe_link Clams on the Half Shell with Fresh Mayonnaise %}. Earlier
in the day, though, I broke out the stick blender and some avocado oil to make some
[homemade mayo](https://downshiftology.com/recipes/how-to-make-homemade-mayonnaise/) using
a recipe I found online. It was super easy and the mayo is delicious.

Then it was time to get into the clams.

I tried using my oyster knife and then a
butter knife but both were way too big to get into the shell. So, instead I used
an old paring knife while wearing an anti-cut glove.

This was the way, and soon I had about a dozen clams open.

To accompany them, I took the mayo from earlier and divided it up. One third was the
original mayo. Another third I added a finely minced garlic clove, some pepper, and
a bit more lemon juice to make an aioli. The last third I mixed in some Sambal Olek
to make a spicy mayo.

All in all, the clams were fine. We absolutely love oysters on the half shell, but
clams on the half shell are simply OK. The mayos as an accoutrement is an amazing
idea. Can't wait to try the spicy mayo on some oysters.
