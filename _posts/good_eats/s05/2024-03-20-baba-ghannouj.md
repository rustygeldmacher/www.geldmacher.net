Spent a couple weeks with the folks in Florida and wanted to get at least one recipe
in while we were there. Since we usually start the evening with cocktails and apps, I
figured that {% good_eats_recipe_link Baba Ghannouj %} would be a good one to try.

I started by grilling a medium-sized eggplant, kept on the grill for the full 30 minutes
recommended by the recipe.

After that it was a matter of getting everything into the food processor. Instead of
a half-bunch of parsley, I used about a handful, and am glad I did -- a half bunch
would have been overwhelming. Once everything was mixed, I let it hang in the fridge
for an hour or so.

It came out great -- my parents absolutely loved it. We rated it a 3, because while
it was good, I'm not sure we'll make it again.
