I knew going into this one that it wasn't going to be _great_ chowder. I knew
that because I made this {% good_eats_recipe_link Clam Chowder %} a long time
ago while I was creating my own recipe. I did end up using a lot of the ideas
from this one in mine, such as steaming whole clams and using the resulting
juices in the chowder.

The thing that struck me right away about this one is that it's _very_ heavy on
the potatoes. Six cups is a lot -- I only used a bit more than 4 cups and it was
still too much.

Even after using the stick blender: too many potatoes in the chowder. I stopped
blending when I thought I might be starting to make clam-flavored mashed potatoes.

Also, I forgot to get a photo of the soup in bowls. Anyway, the chowder is fine.
It's passable and we ate the whole batch over the weekend, but I wouldn't make
this recipe again.
