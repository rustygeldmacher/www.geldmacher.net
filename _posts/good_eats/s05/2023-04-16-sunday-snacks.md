While Gemma is laid-up on the couch recovering from foot surgery, I thought it would be a
good day to just crank out a bunch of snacks from season five.

Since we did the baked mac and cheese the previous day, it was only natural to start with
some {% good_eats_recipe_link Next Day Mac and Cheese "Toast" %}. Deep frying is a bit of
a production, so I started by getting my fry station going.

The recipe didn't have much info as to how long to fry them, so I checked and poked them
periodically until I felt they were done. The smaller pieces took about 2 minutes, and the
larger pieces took 30-60 seconds more.

In the end they were absolutely amazing. We ate them with a little jarred marinara we had
left over in the fridge. I'm glad I only made half a dozen or so because we could have eaten
these all day non stop.

Later in the afternoon I set out to make {% good_eats_recipe_link Granola %}, which is
something I've always wanted to try out. It couldn't have been easier to just mix a bunch
of stuff together and pop it in the oven.

The comments online suggested not to stir it as often as the recipe says, and that way you'll
end up with more chunks. So I only stirred it three or four times while it cooked.

This made a TON of granola. So much that I bagged up a bunch and gave it away to everyone I
saw that day. It is really, really good. We ate it by itself and on yogurt. Will definitely
be making this again some day.

The final snack of the day was {% good_eats_recipe_link Radonsky for the New Millenium %},
which I sort of think of as "easier clams casino" maybe? It's weird because a Google search
for "Radonsky" brings up basically nothing, and Alton didn't even say this recipe's name in
the episode. Anyway, I started out by opening a dozen clams and sprinkling them with the
"stuffing" mix. Then I got some bacon grease hot and popped them face-down into the pan to cook.

We served them up with a little parsley and some malt vinegar and they were delicious.

These were really easy and delicious -- I can see doing this for company as a classy appetizer.
