Vivian's family birthday celebration was Saturday and we held a little cookout
for it. Along with hot dogs, grilled chicken, and sausages I decided to make
{% good_eats_recipe_link Cold-Fashioned Potato Salad %} as a side dish.

It was great, and some people went back for seconds and thirds. It was a bit
of a pain to make though -- there's a ton of ingredients and you need to do
the potatoes the night before. It's delicious though, so if there's another
occasion to make a fancy potato salad, this will be my go-to.
