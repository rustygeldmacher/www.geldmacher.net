It took me a while to start on Season 5, but this weekend I got things going. For dinner
I began with the {% good_eats_recipe_link Baked Macaroni and Cheese %}.

This is definitely a "grown up" mac n cheese -- the onion and bay give it a real savory
background of flavor that works really well. I didn't have any mustard powder so I left
it out of the recipe, but would really like to give it a try next time.

For dessert we went with brownie sundaes, so into the oven went a batch of
{% good_eats_recipe_link Cocoa Brownies %}.

To go with the brownies I made up some
{% good_eats_recipe_link Cocoa Syrup %}, and put it all together with some ice cream.

The brownies were alright, but not that much better than boxed mix ones. They were
very fudgy, with a dark chocolate flavor, and not overly sweet. The syrup was good as well,
also not overly sweet.
