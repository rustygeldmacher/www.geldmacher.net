Saturday morning was a perfect time to make {% good_eats_recipe_link Steel Cut Oatmeal %} for
breakfast, since weekends are when you can afford to spend 40 minutes on breakfast.

I was a bit nervous about not stirring for 25 minutes, but in the end it worked out well and
the cinnamon and brown sugar was a great addition!

In the evening I made up some {% good_eats_recipe_link Hot Cocoa %} mix, and we tried it out
with hot water, which was good but not great. On Sunday we made some more for dessert, this
time mixing it with hot milk, and that was amazing. Milk is definitely the way to go for this.

I think I might mix up a whole bunch of this around Christmas and give it away.
