What better thing to do on a snowed-in day than try out some Good Eats recipes?

Today I decided for a late lunch we'd have some squid stir fry aka.
{% good_eats_recipe_link Squid Vicious %}. It started with some frozen squid that I
ran under the tap to thaw. I took the bodies apart, cut, scraped, scored, and
quartered them.

It's worth noting that the online recipe leaves out the scraping part, so I don't
know how important that actually is. After prepping the bodies, I then got all the
rest of the ingredients prepped and ready for a very quick cook.

I went back and watched the episode, and I realized that it's very much about using
a wok, and even a turkey fryer burner to get it tremendously hot. Well, I have a turkey
fryer but I don't have a wok, so this would have to be done in a pan, at the highest
heat my stove could put out.

After a quick cook, we plated it over some sushi rice and sat down to lunch.

This recipe was _surprisingly_ delicious. The squid was perfect. It rolled up into
little ribbons, and it was tender, flavorful, and not in the least bit rubbery. The
flavor of the stir fry itself was fantastic, my guess due in no small part to the
miso broth stir fry sauce. This is one of the Good Eats recipes I'd been dreading and
putting off because I thought it'd be bleh. But fortunately, I was wrong.

My hunch is that this recipe would be great for just any general stir fry. Using
shrimp or chicken marinated the same way in soy sauce and corn starch would make
any protein perfect for this. Will most likely reach for this recipe any time I
want to make a stir fry. Maybe next time I'll even try a wok!
