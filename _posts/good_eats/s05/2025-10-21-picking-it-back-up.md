It's been quite a while since I've been back into this project, and a lot has
happened in the mean time. Shortly after the last recipe I made, Gemma was
officially diagnosed with Celiac. Then in the summer of 2025, Vivian was
diagnosed Celiac as well. So now 2/3 of the family is gluten free, which has
been quite an adjustment.

It will have its effect on this project -- from here on out I am going to try to
make each recipe gluten free if at all possible.  Some recipes of course will
need to be adjusted, and there will be some that I won't be able to share with
the girls. I'm going to try and keep the number of those to a minimum. When
there's a Good Eats recipe that requires ingredients that contain gluten, I may
completely stray from AB's original guidance and just do my best to make a
gluten free version of whatever's being made.

To get back into the swing of things, on Friday night I put some ingredients together
into the little 2.5 quart slow cooker for some {% good_eats_recipe_link Overnight Oatmeal %}.
Thankfully Bob's makes [gluten free steel cut oats](https://www.bobsredmill.com/product/gluten-free-steel-cut-oats) which were perfect for this.

The show's recipe called for using dried figs and dried cranberries, but we tried it
with dried cherries and dried apricots. The cherries were a great addition, but the apricots
really overpowered everything else.

Then on Sunday I decided to make us a dessert treat for later in the evening by putting
together two gelatin recipes: {% good_eats_recipe_link Sparkling Gingered Face %} and
{% good_eats_recipe_link Cinnamon Cherry Heart %}. I had bought these small heart and
brain molds to use for this, so instead of a face I used brains for the sparkling ginger
gelatin.

I did notice that on the online recipe for the ginger face, there's a single comment saying
it's all wrong and in the wrong order. I went back to the episode to verify this, and sure
enough the comment is right. The real recipe should be more like:

1. Pour 1 cup ginger ale into a bowl
2. Sprinkle 2 packets gelatin over the ginger ale
3. Let bloom for 3-5 minutes
4. Microwave on high, stirring every minute until temperature reaches 150°F (no higher)
5. Slowly pour 1 cup champagne into the warm gelatin mixture, stirring constantly
6. Refrigerate for about 1 hour until it reaches egg-white consistency
7. Pour into mold and refrigerate until set

The gelatin _itself_ came out perfectly -- completely clear, very well set.
However, the flavor of both was just... gross. We couldn't figure out why these
flavor combinations would be used. We figured maybe this is something like
they'd do in the 1940's or something, but anyway we'll never make these
particular flavors again.

Later that night I put in some oats using only dried cherries for additions.
Monday morning we tried it again and still were underwhelmed. The fruit just
seems to take over and really detract from the oat's flavors. I didn't get a
photo of that one.

Monday evening we were planning to do a sausage and root vegetable bake for dinner, so
as a little appetizer I decided to make some {% good_eats_recipe_link Squash Soup %}. The
recipe calls for using two large butternut squash, but I only used a single squash and
halved the rest of the recipe.

It came out great. A wonderful belly warmer as the weather is starting to get a bit
colder this time of year. I think this will be added to my go-to rotation. In my version
I only used a pinch of white pepper, and way less than the half a tablespoon of salt
that the recipe calls for. I used a couple pinches on the squash itself, and then a
couple pinches in the soup. By the way, I think next time I'll cut the squash up
before roasting it -- trying to scrape it out of the hot peel was a pain, and I think
by cutting it up I'd get a bit more even cooking.

And finally, since the two previous overnight oats attempts were both mediocre, I
decided that I'd try one more time, this time without fruit additions. I followed
the recipe exactly, just leaving out the fruit, and this time the family did enjoy
them. Something about adding the dried fruit was just too reminiscent of fruit cake
I guess...
