Made {% good_eats_recipe_link Mushroom Crepe Cake %} as a side dish tonight
to go along with some salmon and asparagus. It's a fantastic dinner addition!

It started yesterday when I made a batch of savory crepes. This batch turned
out way better than the batch I made for crepes suzette. I followed the
savory crepe recipe that goes along with the cake recipe, and I used about 2
teaspoons of dried rosemary for herbs. Also, this time as an experiment I
made the crepes gluten free by using a cup of Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All
Purpose Flour, along with a quarter teaspoon of xanthan gum. Each crepe took
about 1.5 ounces of batter in my 8-inch nonstick pan. After letting them cool
I popped them in fridge overnight.

Then tonight I started by dicing up a pound of mushrooms and making the filling
as instructed in the recipe. I used shredded mozzarella instead of provolone,
because that's what I could find.

I then stacked crepe-filling combos until I used all of the mushroom mixture. I
ended up using 6 crepes total.

Now, the recipe says to throw it all under the broiler, but since the crepes were
out of the fridge, I popped it into the 350 degree own alongside the asparagus,
giving the cake about 10 minutes to warm through. Topped it with some chives, cut
it into 8 pieces and we had an amazing side dish.

This one is delicious, yet involved, and doesn't yield a crowd-serving portion, so
I'll save this for small gatherings, but definitely do it again some time!
