I've been looking forward to the crepes recipes in this season, and what better
way to begin than to make some {% good_eats_recipe_link Crepes Suzette %} for
Saturday night dessert?

It starts with making up a whole mess of sweet {% good_eats_recipe_link Crepes %}.
This was the first time I've ever made them, and there's definitely a learning
curve here. Flipping was the hardest part. I also needed to get a feel for how much
batter was the right amount, and when they were done. I landed on: about an ounce
and a half of better for my 8-inch pan, and deciding they're done when there's
just a little bit of browning going on.

When the stacks of crepes were done, it was time to make the sauce and cook them in
it. I used Cointreau for the orange liqueur, and a full stick of butter. Together
with the sugar it creates a kind of caramel sauce which is delicious but _very_
sweet. I think next time I'll use half the amount of sugar for the sauce (the recipe
called for 2.5 Tb, I think I will try 1Tb).

I topped them with some vanilla ice cream, but it melted really fast so the pictures
of the finished product are... pretty bad. Thankfully, the whole thing put together
was fantastic. We still have a few left over sweet crepes, which we might just heat
up and top with chocolate sauce and whipped cream.
