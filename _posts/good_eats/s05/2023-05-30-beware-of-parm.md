A couple of recent updates for some Season 5 recipes. Not a ton to say about each, hence
why they didn't warrant their own posts.

Last week I made some {% good_eats_recipe_link Leftover Baked Potato Soup %} for dinner.

![potato soup](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AJFCJaUwZzLZgZSp1P-olXP8h_Xp7l8m_erYGjBCqsPqKfOYQTJmQkmQeFt8D3i88r1ZXV0ZFn6ys5U7kMCIPS7AOhlCXgMSZyheZEv2pfkyZ4gW_YzT8GRHaYdgvV-9hxAFu8WHVjsDqdzoBhYFJPbdrN0-=w600)

I found it to be quite tasty, but I used a particular brand of parmesan cheese high in
[butyric acid](https://choosingcheese.com/why-does-parmesan-cheese-smell-like-vomit/) which
some folks react harshly too, causing Gemma to be physically unable to eat it. So, this
might be one to try again some other time.

Then last night I made {% good_eats_recipe_link Eggplant Steaks %} as a side dish for
grilled burgers.

Again, these were quite tasty, but even though I used a different brand of parmesan for
the topping, Gemma found them hard to eat. Needless to say, the ratings for these two recipes
are just my own. Next time I need to make sure to remember that when I
make stuff with cooked parmesan that I should do some with and some without!
