I had meant to do the {% good_eats_recipe_link Pumpkin Bread %} in the fall when
there were plenty of fresh pumpkins around, but things just got way too busy. Now
is as good a time as any, so I went for it even though you can't get pumpkins this
time of year.

That's OK though -- the comments on the recipe page were full of folks that used
canned pumpkin as a substitute (note: NOT pumpkin pie filling, just [pure unsweetened
pumpkin puree](https://thrivemarket.com/p/thrive-market-organic-pumpkin)). People also
mentioned that including the pumpkin seeds was gross, so I left those out as well.

The recipe was easy and the muffins came our great! Some people in the comments also
said they added a little nutmeg so I added a pinch or so. Also, the recipe says 30
minutes for muffins but it took these about 45 to cook through. Now that I have this
under my belt I'll make a point to get a pumpkin in the fall and make these again
with the fresh shredded pumpkin.
