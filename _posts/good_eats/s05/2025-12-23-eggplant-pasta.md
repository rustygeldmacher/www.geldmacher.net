Between holiday parties and entertaining I thought I'd slip in a dinner of
{% good_eats_recipe_link Eggplant Pasta %}. I started by purging a couple of
eggplants.

Then sliced them up thin to look like strands of pasta.

Finally, I finished off the recipe in the pan as instructed.

The result was underwhelming. We really though it'd be better, but it's still just
sort of bland eggplant. The sauce was great though, and I'd use this again along
with some actual pasta, and then some protein like grilled chicken or shrimp.

Probably won't do this one again.
