For dinner tonight I thought I'd do a couple of Season 5 recipes that seemed
like they'd go well together when combined with some grilled chicken.

In the morning, I started by cooking up a one of the packs of homemade bacon
I made a few weeks ago and saving off the resulting drippings. This would be
the base of the dressing for {% good_eats_recipe_link Bacon Vinaigrette with Grilled Radicchio %}.

When it was time to start dinner, I first shredded up a pound of yukon gold
potatoes and 4oz of onion. After all the shredding was done I then put it all into
some cheese cloth and squeezed as much liquid from it that I could. This was the
base for the {% good_eats_recipe_link Potato Roesti %}.

While the grill was heating, I started the roesti. I had two 8-inch pans so I could
do two at a time.

To flip them I used the lid trick that AB used in the show, and it went pretty smooth.

I continued doing roestis and putting them in a 200-degree oven to keep warm.

Meanwhile, I had some chicken on the grill and put the radicchio on there as the chicken
was finishing up. I microwaved the now-congealed bacon grease and whisked up the
dressing. It was dark out and my grill area isn't super well lit, so I didn't notice
that grilling the radicchio took more of the color out of it. It looked pretty sad when
I got it back inside.

However, both dishes were delicious. This salad dressing is really great, though not
terribly good for you, with the bacon grease and the sugar, but it would be a good one
to make for dinner guests with a green salad, tomatoes, croutons, and bacon crumbles.

The roestis were a huge hit, too. We ate them with a little sour cream, and we wer all
sad when all four were gone. Cooking them is a bit of a pain, so next time I think I
would try using my electric griddle and making smaller ones, kind of like I do with
pancakes.
