This morning I started my day by making some savory crepes so later I could make
{% good_eats_recipe_link Crepe Quiche Lorraine %} for lunch. I've made crepes a
couple of times already for Season 5, and I think this time I really had it dialed
in.

I discovered that the heat on the pan should be much lower than I'd usually think.
I used a quarter tablespoon of unsalted butter per crepe in my 8" nonstick pan,
and 1.5oz of batter per crepe.

After making the crepes, sauteing the onions, crumbling the bacon, and shredding the
cheese, I was ready to put them together.

Then I poured them:

And it was into the oven. I had a ton of left over eggs and cheese so I took the rest
of it and made a little frittata. The recipe said to cook at 350 for 15m until the egg
is set, but I found that it needed more like 25m.

The quiches were OK. It's funny because you'd think that because each individual
ingredient is great, that the combination of them all would be fantastic, but they
were basically underwhelming. With the amount of work it took to put this recipe
together, I probably won't make this one again.
