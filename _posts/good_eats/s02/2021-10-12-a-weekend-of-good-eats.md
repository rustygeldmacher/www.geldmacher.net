We had mostly no plans for this long holiday weekend, so I figured I'd kick off Season 2
with a bang. Did a big shopping run on Friday afternoon and then pretty much
cooked all weekend. What a blast!

Friday night started off with {% good_eats_recipe_link The Fungal Saute %}, which
we used to top some home-made pizzas.

Saturday morning I figured I'd break out the Chemex to do
{% good_eats_recipe_link True Brew %} using the same ratios that AB does.

While sipping my coffee, I got to work on the {% good_eats_recipe_link Free Range Fruitcake %}
using the dried fruit I had macerated in rum the night before.

I only have an 8-inch
loaf pan so with the leftover batter I used a muffin tin to make 4 fruitcake muffins.
In the future, this is probably the way to go. I was keeping an
open mind, but after it was done it was hard to eat. Gemma's mom thought it was
edible at least, as long as you put butter on it. Neither Gemma or I could stomach
it, and I ended up tossing most of the loaf, and sending the muffins home with
Gemma's mom. Will most likely never make a fruitcake again.

Saturday night we started by making {% good_eats_recipe_link That Ol' Cap Magic %}
as an appetizer, and they were delicious.

![mushroom caps apps](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLX2XO32KJi8FUtbBvZT4wIQJzxxaA2eoWJBTiun8qzhgNRUQBUtkhagw6LGl7c7kmHIMoNMJz8ZYXRvl3XEy2bVRSxi1pos2aJO9OApqFtwn9FdjktwMMSeGGF1ADZoQQps90koQ6jSsucazP1r0964=w600-no?authuser=0)

Dinner was {% good_eats_recipe_link Good Eats Meat Loaf %} with
{% good_eats_recipe_link Better Than Grannie's Creamed Corn %} on the side. The
creamed corn was phenomenal, and it's something I'd definitely make again, even
though getting the kernels off the cobs was a bit messy.

![creamed corn](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLVpP3-KzuByfNsXRRwDBH3xNCys7hQR0cyuVE7QG2WGeUWTc-Lg4vylpFBoUF-8XrIv5-RNiQRSNT3rPWaJA5mNe6NEyS1tnjdTgerthJ7XK38TsmkDxUAeZqvJ2RIrKF9xMrs6PEYtUo56A4eUyI5P=w600-no?authuser=0)

The meat loaf was good as well, though a bit on the spicy side. It was almost
like a load of taco meat, which isn't a bad thing, but next time I'll leave out
the red pepper and chili powder. But, the glaze was awesome and gave the loaf
a flavorful, crunchy crust.

Sunday night we hard pork chops and {% good_eats_recipe_link 10 Minute Apple Sauce %}
with a side of {% good_eats_recipe_link Creamed Corn Cornbread %}. The apple sauce
was good and complemented the grilled chops very well.

![apple sauce before](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLU7wJ5OTcLq39ooSPzjrf9lX10k9WrqgrKaz2XYDTzTSg1nlb0Dmc0lhzhMq38trS1XZvyREPr5h8ExVAqtepztPrLlQzPZY9ZteYJvwuRUE_myBthW1U7AvwgqTXkvZQd7PueEOpE7nrPaMjPa43_3=w600-no?authuser=0)

The cornbread was OK, definitely not a 2, but it was a little dry. Vivian did have a lot of
fun helping me make it though!

Finally, to top the long weekend off I decided to cook up a batch of
{% good_eats_recipe_link Who Loves Ya Baby-Back? %} ribs. They were flavorful and
delicious, and cooking them with liquid was an interesting addition to
the way I usually do them in the over with just a dry rub. I think if I had
cooked them longer than 2.5 hours they would have been more "fall off the bone"
but they were tasty nonetheless and Vivian just crushed them one after another.

And that's it! One holiday weekend and got through almost half of Season Two!
