I made up the {% good_eats_recipe_link Spiced Blueberry Jammin' %}, canned it in the way
AB shows in the episode, cooled the jars and ... didn't seem to get a vacuum
on the lids. Not exactly sure why, though I might have second guessed myself
because I came back later and the lids didn't "pop" anymore. However, I had
already opened them out of curiosity so they definitely lost any kind of
"preserved" that they had.

The jam itself though was pretty good. I don't usually use a lot of jams and
jellies normally, and I'd probably choose strawberry if I did, so even though
this was a good experience to learn the basics of preserving, probably won't
make it again.

File this one under: I get the idea.
