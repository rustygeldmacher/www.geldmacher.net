Well the {% good_eats_recipe_link Fondue Vudu %} wasn't so great.
Rather than coming together as a nice, smooth cheese
sauce, it turned into a clumpy and often stringy mess. The flavor was OK
but not good enough to make us ignore the consistency. It's too
bad because I had prepared a lot of great stuff to dip into it -- summer
sausage, roasted baby potatoes, bread chunks, and blanched broccoli.
