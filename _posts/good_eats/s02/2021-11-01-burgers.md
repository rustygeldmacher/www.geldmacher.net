I've been looking forward to grinding meat in the food processor for the
{% good_eats_recipe_link Burger of the Gods %}. It was a cool experience,
and the burger came out great, except that I definitely left too many of
the gristly parts of the steak in when I cut it up. Gemma's burger had so
much gristle she couldn't finish it, yet Vivian's had none. I also prepared
them with just salt in the burger mix, but next time I'd probably add in
all the usual stuff I use (an egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic power, etc.)

I prepared mine to eat the way Alton did on the show: a toasted bun with
just some mayo. It was good! But I do like my burgers with a bit more toppings
and condiments. Overall though, a great burger.
