Tried out two Season Two recipes last night. First up was the
{% good_eats_recipe_link Pantry Friendly Tomato Sauce %}. To me, this sauce was
fantastic. Gemma doesn't really care for the "roasted tomato" flavor in anything,
so next time I want to try this without the broiling step -- perhaps doing the
whole sauce in a big skillet. Regardless, though, a really great red sauce that
is easy to make.

Later on I went to B.J.'s place to watch a movie and brought with me the stuff
for {% good_eats_recipe_link Plain Brown Popper %}. I just dressed it up with a
little garlic salt and melted butter, and it was a great snack. This "recipe" is
more like a method, though, which is why I rate it 0, or N/A. There's a ton of
ways to dress up and customize popcorn, and next I'll probably try putting some
clarified butter and tumeric on it.
