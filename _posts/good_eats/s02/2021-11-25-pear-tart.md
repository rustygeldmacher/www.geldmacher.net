I had a feeling I might save a dessert for the last recipe in Season Two.
So here I was with only {% good_eats_recipe_link No Pan Pear Pie %} left,
and it just so happened to be Thanksgiving. That was just a coincidence, but
a happy one -- I was able to serve this with Thanksgiving dinner, and the
reviews were great. The tart was sweet but not _too_ sweet like some of the
pies we had. It was nice and balanced, and the crust was amazing.

Even though I didn't get it to look as great as Alton did on the show, the
taste made up for its funny looks.

### Reflections on Season Two

Season Two started off with a whimper, in the form of a fruitcake. However,
I'm really glad I started with that because I would have just been dreading
it the whole time.

As I started off the season, we were a bit underwhelmed by some of the recipes.
The meatloaf was a bit too spicy, the stuffed mushrooms were good but not mind
blowing, and I was expecting way more from the ribs.

But as we approached the latter end of the recipes, we hit on a bunch of 5-rated
ones. The fish and chips were awesome, and this will be the only way I ever
make shrimp cocktail from here on. I'm not sure I'll ever make this pear tart
again, but I'm really glad I did.

I did rush a little bit through the end, though, because I wanted to make sure
I was on Season Three after Thanksgiving to get to the recipes from Remains
of the Bird using our leftovers. Mission accomplished, now let's see what Season
Three has in store...
