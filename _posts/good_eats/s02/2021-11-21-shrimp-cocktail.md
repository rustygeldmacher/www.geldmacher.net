Made {% good_eats_recipe_link The Shrimp Cocktail %} for a pre-dinner snack
tonight and it was awesome. The brine made the shrimp salty and sweet, and
broiling cooked them to perfection. The cocktail sauce was tangy, sweet, and
spicy.

A real crowd pleaser -- both Gemma and Vivian loved it. This is how I'm going
to prepare shrimp cocktail from now on.
