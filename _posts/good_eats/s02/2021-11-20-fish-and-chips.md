We're getting close to the end of Season Two, so I'm starting in on the recipes
that I've been procrastinating on for one reason or another. Tonight it was
{% good_eats_recipe_link Chips and Fish %}, which I'd been putting off because,
well, frying is kind of scary.

Turns out, while it did make a huge mess and took quite a while, the fries and
the fish were both _fantastic_. The fries were crispy with a nice fluffy inside,
the fish batter was light and crispy, and the fish itself was flaky and delicious.

There was a moment at the beginning where I thought I'd screwed up the fries,
because I misread or misremembered the recipe and thought the fries were blanched
at 220, not 320. I didn't realize that until I had finished them, so I washed them
off and dried them again, then started over. Fortunately it didn't seem to make
a difference and the fried were great.

We served the meal with some homemade tartar sauce, which went like this:

* 1/4 C mayo
* 2 dill gherkins, finely chopped
* 1 tsp dried dill
* Squirt of lemon juice
* Pinch of sugar
* Pinch of kosher salt

It was a great compliment to a delicious meal!
