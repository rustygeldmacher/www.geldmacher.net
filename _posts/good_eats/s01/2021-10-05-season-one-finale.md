I attempted to do the {% good_eats_recipe_link Striped Bass in Salt Dome %}
about a week ago, but after visiting all the seafood
shops and supermarkets in the area (there's like 4 or 5) I discovered
that whole fish isn't very common. So I started
calling around until I found a place about 30m away that sells whole
fish every day.

At first I sought out a striped bass like Alton used in the show,
but then I learned that the
[minimum size you can buy is 35"](https://www.onthewater.com/news/2020/04/22/massachusetts-sets-commercial-striped-bass-quota-at-735240-pounds).
That's like 18-20 _pounds_ of fish, oh and striper is like $25 a
pound. So, yeah that idea was out.

Instead I ended up with a ~3 pound haddock, which was nice size for the
three of us.

I have to admit I was skeptical of this one, but in the end it turned
out great (if not a tad overcooked, which was my fault not the recipe
or the technique). The flavor was great, with the citrus and herbs
giving the meat a great subtle flavor. Also, just to note, the fish was
not salty at all.

### Reflections on Season One

And that wraps up season one. From start to finish it took a little
less than 2 and a half months.

So far the project has been really fun and I've cooked some stuff
that I never really thought I would.

Can't say that I was too surprised the last recipe would be the
fish in the salt dome, or that three of the last four would be
desserts.  I started pretty fast through the recipes then slowed way
down when it got to these. Season Two only has 2 or 3 desserts so
hopefully I won't have that lull at the end.

There were some great surprises in Season One though. I've never
made biscuits, shortcake, or scones before and I don't think I
would have if it weren't for this. Now I have these recipes in
my back pocket for when I need them. Making ice cream is another
skill I'm happy I've picked up.

For Season Two, I'm going to make sure to start earlier on the ones
I'd rather put off, so I'm not dragging my feet by the end. And it's
going to start with that fruit cake...
