I'd been looking forward to making the {% good_eats_recipe_link City Ham %} ever since
I read the reviews on the recipe page. People _rave_ about this one so I wanted to see
for myself. I started with an 8lb shank-end grocery store ham, and had fun cutting some
diamond shapes into it. If you look closely you can see them:

![diamond shapes](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEV7XRhL0f3MbnP2U5NlUMQms62aFsS0dLNNdizk31KV1bPrDlDOnANC9ggtAHJn-juNjRScjD9R4V5tIgz4QvCIYgW7M9dbUPnvGErF6p1r0-SUz1O0JJ0N3hgbI7wgvheuopNNlO6BnuPJNTD5R0jR=w600)

Cooked it for just over 3 hours before taking it out and peeling off the skin and the
layer of fat as best I could. I probably could have cut the diamonds a bit deeper,
because I had to do some serious peeling. I then brushed it with mustard, patted on
brown sugar, sprayed with apple juice (lots of people in the comments used apple juice
instead of bourbon), then packed with food-processed ginger snap crumbs.

It was then into a 400 degree oven (I bumped it up 50 degrees because I saw in the comments
that people had trouble keeping the crust on at 350). Another 45 minutes and it was done.

I forgot to take photos of it sliced, but it was fantastic. The crust was sweet and crunchy,
and it largely stayed on the ham. The meat was moist and flavorful. Great method for ham!

With the ham we had some of {% good_eats_recipe_link Vlad's Very Garlicky Greens %} made
with kale. I opted for "medium" garlicky but using 5 large smashed cloves plus a large
sliced up clove.

Once again, in the ham-induced excitement of the moment, I forgot to photograph the kale
in the pan. Instead here it is plated:
