I've been looking for an excuse to get an Instant Pot, and the Pressure episode was the
final push I needed, so I got a deal on one and set out to make
{% good_eats_recipe_link AB's Beefy Broth %}.

I started by salting and oiling 2 pounds of beef shank and 1 pound of oxtail, then using
the Instant Pot's saute mode to give them a nice sear.

I then added the veggies and the water. This filled the pot right up to it's max fill
line. I kept the pot on saute and waited for it to boil, but taking its temp for a bit
told me it probably wasn't boiling any time soon, so I decided to just skip that step.
I don't think it made much difference in the end, though.

I set it to pressure cook for the full 50 minutes as listed in the recipe.

When it was done, I first strained the big stuff out directly through a colander, and then
used a potato masher to squeeze what liquid I could from those solids. After dumping the
colander, I lined it with 2 layers of cheese cloth, and strained the broth through it again
two times.

The initial broth needed seasoning so I added salt bit by bit and tasted until it all seemed
right. I should have measured, but I estimate I added about a teaspoon of salt total to the
finished broth.

In the end, it was delicious. We ended up simply drinking it in mugs over the next few days,
which is a warm and fantastic little snack -- tt's a great time of year for broth, and a mug of
it really hits the spot. I had originally planned to make soup or something with it, but we never
ended up doing that. We did freeze the rest for later use in gravies and stuff, so I look forward
to having that in the toolbox.
