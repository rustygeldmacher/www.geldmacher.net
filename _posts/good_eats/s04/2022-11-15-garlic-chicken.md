As garlic lovers, we were looking forward to {% good_eats_recipe_link 40 Cloves and a Chicken %}.
I started out by quartering a chicken -- something that we've done a few times so far
in this project and I'm starting to get a little better at.

The recipe was pretty easy, just browning up the chicken and tossing it with a bunch of
garlic and olive oil. For the garlic, I used a package of pre-peeled cloves from Whole
Foods, which might be cheating but... really didn't want to peel 40 fresh cloves.

After roasting for 1.5hr, it looked amazing. The garlic cloves were perfectly cooked, and
the legs and thighs were perfect. However, the breasts were almost inedibly dry. The reviews
on the Food Network site mentioned this, but surprisingly only some of them. One thing we
loved though, was eating the roasted garlic on toasts. I put them in a bowl along with the
oil from the pan. It was amazing.

So even though the breasts were a 2, the dark meat was a definite 4. If I did this again, I
would only use legs and thighs, and would probably only cook it for 45 minutes or so.
