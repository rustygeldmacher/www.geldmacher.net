Back to the Good Eats project after a brief holiday + dieting hiatus. Originally I had
planned to make {% good_eats_recipe_link Country Ham %} the finale to the season, but
I've been having a tough time getting a bone-in chuck roast, so I thought we should get
things moving again and do the ham now and the chuck roast last.

Getting a cured and smoked country ham here in Massachusetts appears to be next to
impossible, so I ended up ordering one from [Benton's Country Hams](https://shop.bentonscountryham.com/).
The smallest I could get was a 16.5 pound ham, which I have to say was way bigger
than I ever thought I'd need from a country ham.

It arrived wrapped in paper, in a mesh bag:

I began by cutting off the hock with a hack saw like Alton did in the episode.

After that I popped the ham into the cooler. I began this on Thursday morning, and up
until I prepared it for cooking on Saturday, I changed the water once in the morning and
once again in the early evening.

On cooking day, I put the ham in a disposable roasting pan, filled it up about
half-way up the met with Dr. Pepper, then added some sweet pickle juice to top it all off.

Like the recipe said to, I started it for the first 30m at 400 degrees, then put it down
to 325 for the next 1h 30m. After this, I turned the ham and let it go for another 1h 30m.
After that, the temperature at the thickest part was about 120 degrees, so I bumped the
oven up to 350 and gave it another 30m to get to temp.

I then got the ham out of its Dr. Pepper bath and used my brand new electric knife to
start slicing thin pieces off the ham.

Once it was sliced we gave it a try and ... it was 100% inedible. It was like eating a
piece of salt water. It was so bad I spit it out. I have no idea what went wrong with this,
but it was a complete and absolute failure. I don't know if it's just what to expect with
country ham, or if for a 16 pound ham you have to soak it for days longer, but there was
no way were going to eat this. I had planned a whole dinner around the ham, and instead I
ran out and grabbed a rotisserie chicken. It was just unspeakably horrid.

It's too bad, and I can't really say what went wrong. Usually my last recipe of each
season had gone well, so I'm glad this on wasn't to finish off season 4. Now I'm on the
hunt for that bone-in chuck roast...
