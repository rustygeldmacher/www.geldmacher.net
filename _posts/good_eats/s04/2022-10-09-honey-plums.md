What a quick, easy, and delicious dessert topping. Tonight I whipped up some
{% good_eats_recipe_link Honey Plums %} to serve over vanilla ice cream, and they
did not disappoint!

I cut them a bit smaller than the recipe listing called for, and I think I might
have used too much honey in the pan because they didn't really brown.

In the end, though, they were SO good on top of ice cream. This is one I'll
definitely make again, since we usually have various fruit around and we always
have honey, too.
