Was planning on doing some tacos tonight and figured it would be the perfect
opportunity to make the {% good_eats_recipe_link Salsa %} from season four.
Because I was out shopping anyway, I also figured that pairing the tacos with
some {% good_eats_recipe_link Spicy Pineapple Sauce %} for dessert.

The salsa started with finely chopping a bunch of ingredients.

The fun part was scorching the jalepenos over the burner. In the episode, AB
used his metal steamer insert over the burner, so I tried that myself.

They turned out well, but I think it ruined my steamer. It's all discolored
now, though it does seem to work still. Anyway, once I removed the skins and
chopped them up, the salsa was done.

Alton says to let it sit for 24 hours or so, but it was still really good on
the tacos -- it had a nice fresh taste that went really well with the rest.
You can taste a little hint of the roasted jalepenos. They have a nice combination
of spicy and sweet. Looking forward to seeing how it tastes once it's had time
to meld together!

After the tacos I tried out some spicy pineapple over ice cream, complete with
fried up corn tortillas.

While the salsa was good, the dessert left a little to be desired. I could see
how maybe it would be good with really fresh pineapple, but I found it to be
a little flavorless. I'd make more salsa in the future, but I doubt I'd do the
spicy pineapple again.
