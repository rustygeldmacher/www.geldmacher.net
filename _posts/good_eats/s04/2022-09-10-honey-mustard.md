Had some friends over tonight so I thought it would be a good opportunity to whip up
some {% good_eats_recipe_link Honey Mustard Dressing %} to go along with some
(store bought) pigs in a blanket.

The dressing was good, and it went really well with the piggies. It is thin, so I guess
if you really want a dip or a spread you could leave out the vinegar.
