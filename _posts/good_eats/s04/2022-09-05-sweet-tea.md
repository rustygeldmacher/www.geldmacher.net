Time to launch into Season 4! Pretty excited about this season as there looks
to be a bunch of great mains that I'm looking forward to trying (stuff lobster
anyone?). I'm going to have to do the {% good_eats_recipe_link Smoked Salmon %}
early, because if I save it to the end I'll just procrastinate like I did with
the catfish in Season 3. We'll see.

I actually started Season 4 the other day making both mayo recipes, but we
haven't tried them yet. So, it's {% good_eats_recipe_link Sweet Tea %} that will
start us off.

This was a pretty easy one. I started off making the simple syrup (halved the
recipe) with 3 lemons and a few springs of mint.

The tea couldn't have been simpler -- I bloomed it in a sauce pan and then strained
it into a pitcher.

When everything was cool, we poured some glasses with ice and everyone could
sweeten theirs the way they liked it. It's a great version of iced tea that is
so easy to make. Glad we got this in before the summer completely goes away on us!
