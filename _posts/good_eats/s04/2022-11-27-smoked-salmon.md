Well, I didn't leave this for last, but pretty close. I've had smoked salmon before but
I have to admit I've never really liked it all that much and so I wasn't very excited for
this one. The other thing holding me back was Alton's whole homemade smoker rig, which I
had been considering how to make. But, I had my smoker out after doing a smoked turkey for
Thanksgiving, so I figured if I had a smoker already, why not use it instead of making
something with a cardboard box and hot plate like he did in the episode?

Since I wasn't terribly excited for this, I simply did a 1 pound fillet rather than the
book-ended giant ones he did in the show. I estimated that each of those things was about
four pounds, so I cut the cure recipe by 1/8. I sprinkled the fillet back and front, and
wrapped it up in plastic and foil.

After putting some weight on top and sticking it in the fridge for 24 hours, I then washed
it off and set up a little fan to dry it for a couple hours.

While it was drying I got the smoker going and when it was ready I put the fish on.

The recipe online says to keep the smoker to about 150/160 but I could really only control
the heat to somewhere between 200-220. I'm not sure this made a huge difference in the
end, but it's worth noting. I tested the fish after 20m and took it off the smoker after
30m.

Finally, I let it come to room temperature before the whole family gathered around to give
it a try. Here's where I have to say I wasn't just surprised, I was blown away. It was SO
good. Smoky and sweet, and not fishy _at all_. The three of us stood at the counter with
forks and just crushed this thing. Besides just straight up, we also ate it on crackers
with a little bit of cream cheese too. It was marvelous, and I kind of regretted not doing
more. However, with Christmas coming up, I'm planning to do this again as a gift.
