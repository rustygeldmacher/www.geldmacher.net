Tonight was {% good_eats_recipe_link Fried Chicken %} night! I'd been looking
forward to this one.

I started last night by cutting up a 6-pound boiler/fryer and marinating it in
buttermilk.

Then this afternoon I created my spice shake and set up my left-to-right frying
stations. One thing I noticed in the Food Network recipe comments were people
saying the recipe is way too salty. The shake in the recipe, though, isn't for
using 100% for one chicken! It's for using a bit now and saving the rest for next
fry. I dusted the chicken pieces with the shake until them seemed "well seasoned"
but there was a _ton_ left over. I can't even imagine what it would be like to
use all of it for this one recipe.

I let the dredge dry for a bit while I got the shortening to temperature. There
seems to be a [shortage of Crisco](https://www.fooddive.com/news/bg-foods-b-and-g-crisco-inflation-soybean-oil-rapeseed-canola-private-label/629618/) so I
had to use what I found -- in this case [Spectrum Organic](https://www.spectrumorganics.com/product/organic-all-vegetable-shortening/) shortening.

Once it was up to 350 degrees, I loaded up the pan. Problem was that not everything
fit in at once -- I has to leave the legs out for a second batch.

I did each side for 10 minutes, testing the oil temperature every now and then. The
pieces came out at just under 180 degrees, like AB recommends. After taking those out,
I started the second batch of legs only. For round two, though, I let the oil get a
little too hot and the legs came out a bit blackened. I let them cool to room temperature
while making the rest of our dinner.

Regardless of being slightly burned, the chicken was amazing. Crispy on the outside
and warm and moist on the inside. To serve, I made up a little [Sriracha mayo](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/recipes/sriracha-mayo/) for dipping, which was also fantastic!
