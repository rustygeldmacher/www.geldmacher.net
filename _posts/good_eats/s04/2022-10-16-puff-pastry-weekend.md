Did a lot of work with puff pastry this weekend. On Saturday I made the
{% good_eats_recipe_link Stacked Puff Pastry with Cherries %}. Measuring and cutting
the pieces for the walls was fun.

![the walls](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEUYtaSelQc73Pic7gr_Z3SPkdUrriL34kUomkHUkLefjqNUrJscttofz911KjZEPiyZe-QauvnCzX5RRgGw5CLiu79D4CVR0jSVK547gHXSGikVS8w-kyu2NIq2YGvS-WPvfXSyX2Hbod0WA0gbxrzL=w600)

After the walls came the filling. I had accidentally bought "cherry filling" rather than
"pie cherries" but dumping the can into a colander and rinsing it down produced enough whole
cherries to be salvageable. Also, I didn't have cake crumbs around but we _did_ have some
glazed donut holes in the freezer than I was able to crush up into crumbs to use for the
filling -- it turned out really tasty!

And finally the top. I brushed the top with egg wash and then, as one of the recipe
comments suggested, I sprinkled a bit of sugar over the top.

After 30m at 400 degrees, the crust was a deep golden brown, and not wanting to
risk burning it I did the second 30m at 300 degrees, which worked out fine.

We didn't get a chance to eat it right away so I stashed it in a gallon freezer bag to serve
on Sunday night. For Sunday afternoon, I decided to do the
{% good_eats_recipe_link Salmon Turnovers %} but make them appetizer size. Instead of making
four from a sheet of puff pastry, I made 12. Putting them together was delicate work, and I
thought it was going to be a disaster -- check out my handiwork:

![ready to cook](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEXkN_IRDsjKH-2XR1MBNfdEZYsbw9Y6cV05Z6tPfa5-Y6GcCUzdYVV0HrjtmlhvoLavsfuTzkRXWHH0MIshJpVA8-ivoayZmtI7siMndoARFtk2cF7eYwFjSagPhja9EIXKPoh2bbxAHcC1sooAYgn6=w500)

But, sloppy as they were, they came out looking just great.

![cooked](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEWvps8v4Pk1oYB52Qsv3x_wvS-O9gqnG11RP2NgL7uEIE5ErMB35l8lBuLplVhmNbgeex5cp2_qfrQyvbIzKbj0Fc0SaTdSR9xpnOws6tc3Kt3pSSO7MgkjgmyYUdEf65SammviyNFUPKvziYVVvufu=w600)

However, we weren't really big fans. I think trying the appetizer size caused the puff pastry
to overwhelm the filling, but even so, the filling itself wasn't that great. I think I'd
really like to try a meat filling (AB suggests Manwich) or maybe steak bomb filling.

For dessert, I served up the cherry pastry, with {% good_eats_recipe_link Sweet and Sour Dessert Sauce %}
on top plus a little vanilla ice cream. Rather than cook the honey over the burner in the
metal bowl, I microwaved it then dumped that into the bowl and added the sour cream. So easy!

![dessert sauce](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEX2VDIlpP1ly_NOHVXzJT_4gw1BfbiVCXOU3SATykWRqnC37hx9NQI3RK436pWsTtoDTAod5Oy79q99Q7GvqTTtPRZotvA496hplFBCofDyyORrmlIoyTgb6rtOvNr3XaO2EeK2_7VzBJx77vwpLcDM=w500)

The dessert sauce added a little extra zing to the pastry, and was a nice touch. It's so easy
to make, and would probably be really good with some fruit, like pears or peaches.
