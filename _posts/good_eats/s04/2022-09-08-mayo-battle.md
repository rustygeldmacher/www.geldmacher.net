In season 4, Alton presents two mayo recipes: {% good_eats_recipe_link Mayonnaise %} and
{% good_eats_recipe_link Party Mayonnaise %} -- both of them mayo, but with some slight
differences.

The first -- Mayonnaise -- seems like the "traditional" mayo completely whisked by hand and
adding oil in drop by drop for a good portion of it. I started with this, and once I was done
it felt like my whisking arm was going to fall off.

The second one -- Party Mayonnaise -- was much easier since it was done in a food processor.
While the first recipe had lemon juice and all safflower oil, party mayonnaise called for
lime juice and a few tablespoons chile oil. I didn't have chile oil so I made some by
heating oil in a skillet and pouring it into a bowl with a couple tablespoons of red chile
flakes.

From there it was just a couple seconds in the food processor and done.

The question was how to taste mayonnaise -- what recipes feature mayo? My first thought
was egg salad, so we went with that first.

They tasted basically the same, so the second plan was BLTs. I didn't get a picture of
the side-by-side tasting BLTs but that did the trick -- we were able to taste the
difference. They are both really good, but of course the one that's a huge pain to make
(literally) was the winner. I'm digging the idea of homemade mayo so maybe next time
I'll try the first recipe in the food processor. Best of both worlds maybe?
