I had been waiting {% good_eats_recipe_link Pizza Pizzas %}, but since it
takes some planning ahead to get the dough in the fridge about 24 hours
before cooking, I'd been putting it off. But on Thursday I borrowed my
neighbor's Kitchenaid mixer complete with dough hook, and went to work.
Dough always seems to complicated, and I never know if I'm doing it right,
but I think it came together pretty well.

I left it in the fridge for about 24 hours, took it out, split it, rolled
both balls again, and left them for an hour or so to come to temperature. I
may have even been able to leave them out a little longer, but the dough was
easy enough to work with (which is always something that frustrates me about
making pizza at home -- the dough springing back after you shape it).

I got two approximately 11" x 8" oval shaped pizzas. The first one I did with
just cheese and the second one I topped with sauteed mushrooms and onions. I
then cooked them on my [baking steel](https://bakingsteel.com/) rather than a
stone like in the show. I don't think that makes much difference.

I the end, the second one with the toppings was definitely our favorite (sorry
AB). If I ever get myself a new mixer with a dough hook, I'll be using this as
my go-to pizza dough recipe from now on.
