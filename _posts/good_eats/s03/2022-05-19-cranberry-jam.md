As part of making a turkey dinner in order to make leftover hash (see next post),
I figured I'd make {% good_eats_recipe_link In a Cranberry Jam %}
to go along with the turkey.

It started by first making [Tart Cranberry Dipping Sauce](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/tart-cranberry-dipping-sauce-recipe2-1926844):

Once the sauce was done (I saved some off for my turkey dinner), you then add more
ginger ale and sugar and keep reducing it. The result is a tasty cranberry jam
that was really good on leftover turkey sandwiches.
