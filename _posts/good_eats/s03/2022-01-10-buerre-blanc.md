While we're eating low carb, we might as well get some of the higher-fat recipes
out of the way. So tonight I made up some {% good_eats_recipe_link Raymond Beurre Blanc %}
to go along with some steak.

Also making an appearance was {% good_eats_recipe_link The Fungal Saute %}, a perfect
accompaniment for steak, made extra delicious by the butter sauce.

We loved this, and it was really easy to make. It'll be a go-to when I need a
quick sauce. I did think it was a little too lemony/acidic for my taste, but
Gemma didn't. Next time though, I think I'll try half the amount of lemon juice
and see how that goes.
