Had a few minutes free so thought I'd whip up some {% good_eats_recipe_link Honey Butter %}.
Rather than use a pound of butter and a stand mixer, I just used a single
stick and mixed it in a bowl with a fork.

Tried it on some toast and it's amazing. Going to try it on some mashed
sweet potatoes next, and then some pancakes this weekend. It's delicious!
