I wanted to get into Season Three right after Thanksgiving in order to have
the raw materials for {% good_eats_recipe_link Bird to the Last Drop %} a.k.a.
Good Eats turkey soup. I'm so glad I got the timing right, because this soup
was so easy to make and so delicious.

Everyone loved it, served with some cut up Italian bread and butter. I just
wish the recipe made more -- next time will probably try adding another 32oz
container of vegetable stock.
