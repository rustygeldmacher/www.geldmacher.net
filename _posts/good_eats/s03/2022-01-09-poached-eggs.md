What better use for {% good_eats_recipe_link Poached Egg Tips %} than to make some
Eggs Benedict? The challenge for us is we're currently in a January low-card diet,
but we made it work well!

First I got some poached eggs going.

While they were simmering I made some [keto english muffins](https://healthyrecipesblogs.com/english-muffins/)
and some [easy hollandaise sauce](https://downshiftology.com/recipes/hollandaise-sauce/). When
everything was done, we put it all together with some smoked ham and had an
amazing low carb brunch.
