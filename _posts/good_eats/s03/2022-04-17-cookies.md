The other day I decided that I'd have a one-person cookie bake-off, trying all
three cookie recipes from Season Three's "Three Chips for Sister Marsha":
{% good_eats_recipe_link The Thin %}, {% good_eats_recipe_link The Puffy %}, and
{% good_eats_recipe_link The Chewy %}.

I started by making the dough for each batch and chilling them all together in
the fridge for an hour or so. When it was time to bake, I took all three out of
the fridge and cooked two types at once (I have 2 sheet pans), using a #20 scoop.

Cooking all those batches took hours, but I ended up with a ton of delicious
cookies and the house smelled amazing.

So who won? Well they are all fantastic, but we definitely enjoyed
{% good_eats_recipe_link The Puffy %} most of all. They are like little cakes.
{% good_eats_recipe_link The Thin %} was second, followed by
{% good_eats_recipe_link The Chewy %}. Not to say the chewy was bad -- they are
all wonderful cookies -- it's just the other two are that good.
