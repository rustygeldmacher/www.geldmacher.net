Progress has slowed a bit during the holidays but this week I decided to cook up
a BBQ dinner featuring {% good_eats_recipe_link The Once and Future Beans %} along
with some pulled pork sliders with cole slaw (slaw made by special guest chef Chris).

Cooked the beans for about 6 hours total, and added a little more liquid at the five
hour mark when the beans were tender but not quite done yet.

Gave these a three only because I think I burned some of the bacon fat as I was rendering
it and there are little chunks in the beans that tasted fine but made for a strange
consistency.
