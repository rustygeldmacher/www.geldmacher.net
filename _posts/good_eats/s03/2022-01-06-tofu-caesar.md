Going to try and do Season 3's low carb recipes as we take a bit of a diet in
he new year. Last night we put together some salad with the
{% good_eats_recipe_link No Guilt Caesar %} dressing.

I was skeptical of the tofu, but it was really good. The dressing was creamy,
smooth, and garlicky. This probably won't replace our favorite Caesar dressing
from [America's Test Kitchen](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/10925-kale-caesar-salad),
but it was worth making and we're going to finish the rest off over the next
few days.

Season 3 has a few low-carb-friendly recipes so I'm going to try and get
those done this month.
