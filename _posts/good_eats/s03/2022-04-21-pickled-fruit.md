About a week ago I mixed up some {% good_eats_recipe_link Summer Fruits %} as my
last foray into Season 3 pickling. I actually made it a week and a day ago, and
today we cracked it open from the fridge.

Have to say I was skeptical about pickled fruit -- but this recipe works. They are
a little sweet, and a little tart, and quite tasty. I don't think we'll be craving
them any time soon ("I really want some of those pickled plums!") but they were an
interesting flavor combo and a cool thing to try.
