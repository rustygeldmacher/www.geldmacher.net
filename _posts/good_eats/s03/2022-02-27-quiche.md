Made some quiche (oops, {% good_eats_recipe_link Refrigerator Pie %}) for brunch
today and it turned out great! I used a gluten-free frozen pie crust, some spinach,
shredded cheddar, and some diced up ham steak.

One thing I'll do differently next time is squeeze out the spinach a lot more. I
squeezed it in some paper towels, but probably not enough since it was a little
bit watery.

I cooked it for 35 minutes, checked it, and then popped it back in for another 10.

This was so easy, and delicious. I will definitely be experimenting around with
different types of quiches in the future.
