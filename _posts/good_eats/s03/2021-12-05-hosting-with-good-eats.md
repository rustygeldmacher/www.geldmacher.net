Had Gemma's sister, sister's husband, and nieces over on Friday night and decided
to incorporate some season 3 recipes into the weekend. For dessert on Friday I
made the {% good_eats_recipe_link Flandango %} for everyone.

Like most of the desserts so far, it was the first time I've attempted it, and was
a little nervous, but they were awesome. Used caramel, chocolate, and raspberry-apricot
preserves as the toppings. Next time, I'll cool them in the fridge before serving.

Saturday morning I made up a couple batches of the
{% good_eats_recipe_link "Instant" Pancake Mix %} -- one batch used regular AP flour
and the other used gluten free AP flour.

Both types of pancakes came out great -- we even had a bunch left over to freeze
and eat later.
