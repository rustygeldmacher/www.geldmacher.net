Now that we're rolling off of the New Year's diet break, it's time to get
back into this Good Eats project for real. We've recently taken up a liking
for tofu, so we decided to start with a few more the recipes from the Tofuworld
episode, beginning with {% good_eats_recipe_link Tall & Tangy Tofu Thangy %}.

Not a great start. The drink was just... blah. I mean, it wasn't gross or
disgusting, just _not good_, and besides the fact that it's certainly a dairy-free
frozen drink, we just didn't see the point. This one went unfinished, even
though it pains me to throw food away. Swing and miss, Alton.

For dinner, our main entree was {% good_eats_recipe_link Fillet O'Fu %} with
some veggies on the sde.

Overall it was good, but a little dry and bland. We ended up dipping it in
some hoisin sauce, which was delicious. Ultimately though, we like our usual
method of frying tofu better: cubed, tossed with salt/pepper/corn starch, then
pan fried and eaten over stir-fry.
