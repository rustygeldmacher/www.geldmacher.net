Almost a month since I've gotten back to a Season 3 recipe -- lots in between then
and now, like a 2 week vacation in Florida, and a new puppy.

Started back into it with {% good_eats_recipe_link Home of the Braise %}, a red
cabbage dish. We were not really big fans of this one either (both cabbage recipes
from Season 3 have been disappointing). We won't be making this one again.
