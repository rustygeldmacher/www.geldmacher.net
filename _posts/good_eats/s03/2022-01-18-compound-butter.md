I actually made this a week ago on Jan 11, but wanted to try it on a few things
before giving it a rating. One cool thing about this recipe is that it was the
first time I used the old stand mixer my sister gave me years ago. I started out
trying to use the hand mixer with the whisk attachment but that failed miserably,
so out came the stand mixer and things went swimmingly from there.

I ended up with a lot, so I left some for use now, and some to freeze log-style
like in the show (mine didn't come out as neat and tidy).

![some for now, some for later](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLXBh_g7wXHOIjvCJltSvxhCgxynGTljsfnvzPwJUi76rXTs6yVOwB9ymjLFnJAB1uq66FmD6LVU6uW7LiJkF7FmnZ4A0qNJicHgccHbrxW_S5bouJiAS6jaCFTzkVqgEaHdpOxZ_YLv46kq8PAtJqOv=w600)

This stuff is fantastic. Among other things we've tried it on:

* "[Bread](https://gimmedelicious.com/90-second-keto-bread/)"
* Steak
* Green beans
* Cauliflower
* "[Pasta](https://explorecuisine.com/product/edamame-and-mung-bean-fettuccine/)" and sauce

A great flavor boost for any of these. Looking forward to being off the low carb
thing and trying it on some fresh, warm dinner rolls.
