I'd had the ingredients for {% good_eats_recipe_link Black Bean Salad %} for a while and
I was running out of time before the parsley and cilantro spoiled. So, I thought I'd
whip this up after dinner last night.

It was a pretty easy recipe to make, and while it was cooking I also prepared some
[Chipotle-style cilantro lime rice](https://www.culinaryhill.com/chipotle-cilantro-lime-rice/)
to eat along with the beans.

Once the beans were done, I added the oil, cilantro, lime juice, etc. and let them cool
for a while before putting them in the fridge. To serve, I heat up some of the rice,
then add the beans, then give it another minute or so in the microwave. Top with some
sour cream and hot sauce and it's one great meal!

When I want to have a bunch of black beans around, this is how I'll prepare them.
