This one was a little annoying because I had to make a bunch of other stuff first
so I had leftovers to make the hash with. So one evening I roasted up a couple of
turkey tenderloins over red potatoes. This got me a few of the leftovers. I also
needed to make a batch of [cornbread pudding](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/sweet-corn-bread-pudding-recipe-1949555)
to go along with it.

I was a big fan of the pudding, and I might make it again some day. Once I had all
of the leftovers, I could then make the hash this morning for breakfast:

This made a ton of hash, and it was pretty good. I gave the rest of it to my mother
in law, and she really enjoyed it too.
