Ok so it's been almost a month since we got back, but I've _finally_ finished sorting and uploading the pictures from our recent trip to Hawaii.

In short, Hawaii is incredible. My lady and I spent a week and half there, with our time split between O'ahu and Kauai. O'ahu was wonderful for seeing the sights (Waikiki, Hanauma Bay, Pearl Harbor, etc.) and having fun with our friends. Kauai was the best for outdoor activities and beaches. I highly recommend seeing both of these islands if you ever get to Hawaii!

For me, the highlight of the trip was hiking in [Waimea Canyon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waimea_Canyon) on Kauai. The canyon walls rise about 4,000 feet and they are quite a sight to behold. We hiked down a wooded trail and along the canyon ridge to the top of [Waipo'o Falls](http://www.waterfallswest.com/waterfall.php?id=168) -- a wonderful 4-mile round trip.
