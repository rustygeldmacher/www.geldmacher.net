I tried making the {{ good_eats_recipe_link Chocolate Mousse }} a couple weeks ago
and the attempt failed miserably. When I went to fold the whipped cream into the
chocolate, I ended up with a soupy mess. I think I didn't let the chocolate cool
enough and the whipped cream melted.

This time things went much better!

Spooned it into ramekins, let it set in the fridge, then served it up with some
whipped cream and sliced strawberries.
