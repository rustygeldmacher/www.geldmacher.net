Began cooking Season 1 today!

Putting together a meal with a few recipes from the season is a good way to start
on the list, so I started with:

* [Grilled Salmon Steaks](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/grilled-salmon-steaks-recipe-1910488)
* [The Baked Potato](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/the-baked-potato-recipe1-1908821)
* [Veni Vedi Vinaigrette](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/veni-vedi-vinaigrette-recipe-1938425)

Here are our notes and ratings for each. Check the FAQ for what the ratings mean.

### Grilled Salmon Steaks

* **Crowd**: 4/5
* **Ease**: 2/5
* These were fantastic, would definitely make them again.
* Did the spice mix like in the show for Gemma and me, and just salt for Vivian.
  Both variations were a hit.
* Preparation was a pain though -- the steaks had a ton of pin bones and try as I might
  I couldn't get them all. Tying them was a bit tricky, had do do a couple twice before
  they held together.

### The Baked Potato

* **Crowd**: 4/5
* **Ease**: 5/5
* Would rarely think of doing baked potatoes, but they were great
* An hour plus cooking, though, means they'll probably stay a rarity

### Veni Vedi Vinaigrette

* **Crowd**: 3/5
* **Ease**: 5/5
* This was light and tangy, and dead simple to put together.
* We do a similar dressing with lemon olive oil and white wine vinegar that we like better
