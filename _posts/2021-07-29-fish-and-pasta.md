Continuing on with Season 1, the next couple recipes went into tonight's dinner:

* [Pan Fried Fish](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/pan-fried-fish-recipe-1910675)
* [Pasta](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pasta-recipe1-1939124)

We usually prepare pasta with just butter and cheese, but this prepartion was a good
change of pace. Combined with roasted broccoli, this was a quick and easy weeknight dinner.
