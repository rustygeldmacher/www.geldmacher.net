Continuing on with Season 1, the next couple recipes went into tonight's dinner:

* [Pan Fried Fish](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/pan-fried-fish-recipe-1910675)
* [Pasta](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pasta-recipe1-1939124)

Combined with roasted broccoli, this was a quick and easy weeknight dinner.

Like before, notes and ratings on each:

### Pan Fried Fish

* **Crowd**: 4/5
* **Ease**: 4/5
* Used a large (1 pound) skin-on haddock fillet
* Definitely a great weeknight fish recipe, very easy with relatively few steps
* Loved the butter/caper sauce

### Pasta

* **Crowd**: 4/5
* **Ease**: 4/5
* We usually prepare weeknight pasta with just butter and cheese, so this was a good
  change of pace there. Liked this simple preparation a lot!
