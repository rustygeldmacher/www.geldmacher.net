OK the wedding was a little over a month ago but it's better late than never to announce that I am now married to the love of my life, my wonderful new wife Gemma.

I think my wife summarized it best in [our wedding announcement](http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/weddings/gallery/readers2010?pg=11):



> The ceremony took place at the Monponsett Inn in Halifax on May 29, 2010. Even though the weather threatened to spoil the day, it all worked out. "It was pouring rain for about an hour before the ceremony, before clearing up at exactly 6:30," writes Gemma. "The outdoor ceremony had perfect weather complete with birds chirping and a rainbow over the bride. I guess we got good luck either way, since it rained and shined on our wedding day!"

Thanks to everyone who attended for making it the happiest day of my life!
