Right after I graduated from [WPI](http://www.wpi.edu) graduate school, my parents, sister and I took a 10-day trip to Ireland. After weighing the pros and cons of various approaches to seeing the country, we decided to take a guided bus tour. The tour allowed us to hit all of the major sites, while still giving us a good amount of free time to explore on our own. Being on a tour has among its advantages a tour guide who talked about each place we travelled through, therefore giving us a history lesson we wouldn't have gotten otherwise. As you'll see, the trip really was a history lesson come to life. Being on a tour also gives travelers (well, tourists in this case, I'll admit) a chance to hit major attractions with admissions and activities setup for you beforehand. That means less waiting than there otherwise would be.

Of course, having someone else set your schedule could be seen as a drawback, which is why we viewed the experience as a sort of primer so when we went back (which of course I intend to do), we'll have a good idea of where we want to go and what places we like the best. This trip introduced us to the history, the landscape, and the major things to see. When I go back next, I will engage with the people a lot more and not have to worry in the back of my mind if I'm missing something I should be seeing.

All in all, it was a great experience. The country and landscape are beautiful, the people are friendly and welcoming, and the general attitude was a good one. Two points that people bring up about Ireland didn't seem to apply that much: bad weather and worse food. We were there in late May but only got rain on one day out of 12 (10 touring days plus two travel days). Sure, it was overcast a lot of the time, but staying dry in Ireland seems to be the trick, and we pulled it off. Secondly, the food we ate was absolutely delicious -- especially the full Irish breakfasts -- so I really don't know where that myth comes from. I can't even think of one bad meal we had, never mind the delicious Guinness that awaits you wherever you go.

Below I've reproduced our trip itinerary as given to us by the tour company. I also put links into my [photo gallery from the trip](http://www.flickr.com/photos/geldmacher/sets/72157594570197409/). Enjoy!
