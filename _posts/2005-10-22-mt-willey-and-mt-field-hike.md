### Report

Dan, his brother Rob, and I once again headed up to the White Mountains of New Hampshire to tackle more peaks. This time we hit the peaks of Mount Willey and Mount Field which both lie together on a convenient loop. The hike was fun and the weather largely cooperated. Although the air temperature was around 50 degrees (and around 40 degrees on the peaks), the sun was shining and there was little to no wind. The mountains are a great place in the Fall, and you can see more of it in [the gallery for the hike](http://www.flickr.com/photos/geldmacher/sets/72157594560549263/). Big thanks to Dan for bringing his camera and taking great pictures!
