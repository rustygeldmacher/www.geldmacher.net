### Broiled, Butterflied Chicken

* **Crowd**: 3/5
* **Ease**: 3/5
* The recipe calls for a 3-4 pound chicken, but the smallest I could get
  was a 5 pounder. The chicken came out really moist and tender, however
  I had to add an extra 20-25 minutes to the cook time to get it to temp.
  That's expected, because the recipe is for a smaller bird.
* We think it would have been much better if it used way less pepper. It
  came out so peppery that I had to wash off my daughter's portion.
* AB says that the veggies give all they had during cooking but we ate
  the carrots anyway -- they weren't bad!
* The jus was fantastic! Next time I will turn it into a gravy.

### Mashers

* **Crowd**: 4/5
* **Ease**: 4/5
* Really liked these. Using both russets and red potatoes is a great move.
* Not our all-time-favorite mashed but they were up there. I don't usually have
  buttermilk on hand but this is a good use for it.
