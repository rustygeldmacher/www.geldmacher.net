Getting into the latter half of season one, this is where I'm starting to get
farther out of my comfort zone. I don't typically do baked goods, doughs, pastries,
etc. and Alton sprinkles a lot of them throughout the series. That's good though,
it's one of the reasons I'm doing this in the first place!

Today was {% good_eats_recipe_link Southern Biscuits %}
from the episode "The Dough Also Rises".

But with a small twist. The other night at dinner, Gemma and I were talking about
this project and given that she prefers to eat gluten-free, she asked if I could try
some of these recipes GF. So, for these biscuits I made two half-batches: one with
regular AP flour, and the other with
[gluten free replacement flour](https://www.amazon.com/Bobs-Red-Mill-Purpose-22-ounce/dp/B08WJ8CRCG/).

On the left: with gluten, on the right: gluten free. Not pictured: the one Vivian
immediately stole and scarfed down.

The GF version was just as good as the gluten version, though the dough was a HUGE
pain to work with. It never really formed into a workable dough, but I guess
that makes sense because gluten is what makes doughs, um, doughy.
