Getting into the latter half of season one, this is where I'm starting to get
farther out of my comfort zone. I don't typically do baked goods, doughs, pastries,
etc. and Alton sprinkles a lot of them throughout the series. That's good though,
it's one of the reasons I'm doing this in the first place!

Today was [Southern Biscuits](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/southern-biscuits-recipe3-1948203)
from the episode "The Dough Also Rises".

But with a small twist. The other night at dinner, Gemma and I were talking about
this project and given that she prefers to eat gluten-free, she asked if I could try
some of these recipes GF. So, for these biscuits I made two half-batches: one with
regular AP flour, and the other with
[gluten free replacement flour](https://www.amazon.com/Bobs-Red-Mill-Purpose-22-ounce/dp/B08WJ8CRCG/).

On the left: with gluten, on the right: gluten free. Not pictured: the one Vivian
immediately stole and scarfed down.

The GF version was just as good as the gluten version, though the dough was a HUGE
pain to work with. It never really formed into a workable dough, but I guess
that makes sense because gluten is what makes doughs, um, doughy.

### Southern Biscuits

* **Crowd**: 5/5
* **Ease**: 3/5
* Biscuits were more "cakey" than "flakey" but that's fine -- I think that's the
  intention for this recipe anyway.
* They are SO good, even the GF ones are fantastic.
