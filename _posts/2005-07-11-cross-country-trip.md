In early June of 2005 two intrepid explorers, Jon Suchecki and myself, embarked on a journey of conquest and discovery. We were to attempt driving non-stop [from Hudson, Massachusetts to Denver, Colorado](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=hudson,+ma&daddr=41.372686,-73.580933+to:I-435+S+%4038.938900,+-94.544690+to:denver,+co&mrcr=0,1&mrsp=1&sz=8&mra=dpe&sll=42.147114,-73.586426&sspn=3.473861,6.899414&ie=UTF8&ll=38.959409,-87.802734&spn=29.026607,55.195313&z=5&om=1). We would rest there for a day or so and then complete the journey across the country with Los Angeles as our destination. They said it was a crazy idea. They said we would get tired and need to sleep. They said it couldn't be done. They were wrong.

I've got some photo galleries associated with our trip. The thumbnails in the trip log below will go into the corresponding picture gallery, but if you want to just jump right to the albums, use these links below:

### Part One: Hudson, MA to Denver, CO

Leaving on the morning of June 7th, Jon and I drove his 1998 Subaru Legacy GT straight into Denver, CO. This was the longest part of our journey and it took us a grand total of thirty-two hours and forty-five minutes from the time we first got on the road to the time we parked outside Kevin's apartment in Denver. Along the way we kept a semi-detailed log of the major events, faithfully reproduced for you below. All of the times are according to the clock on Jon's stereo, which was set to Eastern Standard Time for the whole first part of the drive.

### Part Two: Denver, CO to Los Angeles, CA

After an eventful two days in Denver (seeing the White Sox romp the Colorado Rockies, checking out the many bars and restaurants, going to Rocky Mountain National Park) Jon and I hit the road again in the early morning of Friday, June 10th.  This time, final our destination was in sight: Los Angeles. Compared to the first leg of the trip, this fifteen-hour and fifty-minute part of the journey was a piece of cake. Again, here is the trip log we wrote, this time with Jon's clock set to Mountain Time for Denver.

### Trip Summary

So there yout have it: our cross country jaunt. Unfortunately, we didn't record the mileage for our waypoints, but I suspect that could easily be recontructed via Google Maps. We'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. In the mean time, here's a brief summary of our entire trip.

<table class="table">
	<tr>
	  <td>Total time moving</td>
	  <td>42 hours and 55 minutes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Total time stopped</td>
	  <td>5 hours and 40 minutes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Total trip time</td>
	  <td>48 hours and 35 minutes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Total states visited</td>
