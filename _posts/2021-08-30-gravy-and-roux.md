The night before, I made a {% good_eats_recipe_link White Roux %}
in a small skillet, using Bob's Red Mill 1:1 gluten free flour.

After making the roux I popped it in the fridge to use the next day. While at it, I
salted a 2.5 lb top round roast and let it sit in the fridge overnight.

Tonight, I cooked the roast using

all in the name of getting some pan drippings for making

The gravy was fantastic, though I believe I thickened it a little too much. Don't believe
that picture up there, it was really delicious. I don't think I'll ever let pan drippings
go to waste again.
