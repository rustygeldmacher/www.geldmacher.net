### Report

Well we loved hiking Mahoosuc Notch in the snow so much that we decided we were due for another trip up north. This time we went to hike Mount Waumbek, one of the lowest 4000 footers and also one of the most northern of the group. The conditions were great: high temperatures in the mid teens, slightly overcast, excellent visibility, and only a very light snow at times.

Again as with the Mahoosuc hike, preparation was key. We were dressed in many layers, had plenty of water and a reasonable plan to get back before dark. The trail was in very good condition, with firmly packed snow and markers every 100 feet or so. When hiking in the snow it's easy to lose the trail if it's not well marked or there are no footprints to follow. The trail conditions on this hike alleviated any of those concerns.

Hiking in pristine winter conditions is unbeatable. Walking up a mountain surrounded by a forest covered with deep undisturbed snow is almost like stepping into a different world. Though winter hiking brings with it a unique set of challenges (or water kept freezing!) the experience is well worth the extra effort!
