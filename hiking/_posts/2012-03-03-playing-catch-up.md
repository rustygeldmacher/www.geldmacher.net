It might not be clear from this site but I actually have been doing some hiking and traveling since [finishing the New Hampshire 4000's in July of 2010](http://www.geldmacher.net/2010/07/27/fin/). Here's a run down of some of the trips we've done since.

Late in July of 2010, we traveled out to Zion National Park in Utah where we did a couple of really incredible desert and canyon hikes. First was a hike up to Observation Point, one of the best viewpoints in the entire park.

The next day we hiked up Angel's Landing, a giant stone "sail" that juts out into the middle of the canyon. Hiking up a narrow path with drops of hundreds of feet on either side made this one of the most memorable trips I've taken.

In April of 2011, Dan and I hiked up to Tuckerman's Ravine, where we ran into some whiteout conditions in the bowl of the ravine.

July 2011 took us to the Grand Canyon while we were out in Arizona for our family reunion. We did some really fun walks along the canyon rim, and even got there at 4:30am to see the sun rise!

And finally, now that we've finished the New Hampshire 4000 footers the natural thing to do is to focus on the remaining nineteen 4,000 foot peaks in New England. So at the end of July 2011 Dan and I headed up to Vermont to tackle Mount Mansfield, the highest peak in the state.
