We finally took our first hiking trip of the year last weekend, the late start being attributed to [some unforeseen events](http://www.littlebigmind.com/galleries/thumbnails.php?album=119). No matter though, it was if we had never left... To break up the day, we decided to do two relatively short hikes in order to tie up some loose ends. The morning one was a trip to the summit of Mount Osceola, which we missed in February when we [snow-shoed up the East peak](http://www.flickr.com/photos/geldmacher/sets/72157603953618226/).

In the afternoon we hit our second peak, Cannon Mountain. Going by the book time this is a short one (4 miles/3 hours) so the idea was to get that out of the way without having to one day go up north for only that hike. Though, I'm not sure what Olympian they had time that one out because it was more like 4:15 since it was insanely steep for almost half the journey to the summit.

The times were good, and it definitely felt great to get back onto the White Mountains trails again. Only [seven peaks to go](http://www.geldmacher.net/4000-footers/) before we've finished the list, but who's counting? ;)
