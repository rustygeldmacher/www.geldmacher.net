Figured it's about time to post about some of the trips we've taken over the last few months. Let's take a look at them, starting with the most recent.

The most recent hike we did was an overnighter to the most remote 4,000 foot peaks in the White Mountains: [Owl's Head](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl%27s_Head_(Franconia)). The majority of the hike in was flat, about 8 miles worth. Then it's straight up the mountain: 1500 feet in one mile or so. We were chasing the clock, so we went as fast as we could. It was brutal. Fun, though!

Then, back in May we surprised Shawn on his birthday with a camping trip out in the Catskills. As part of the trip we hiked out to [Kaaterskill Falls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaterskill_Falls), one of the highest waterfalls in New York state. The hike was short, not very strenuous, and incredibly rewarding. They were some of the most gorgeous waterfalls I've ever seen.

Finally, in early March our regular hiking crew decided to trek up Mount Whiteface. We got a wonderfully clear day, and the weather cooperated with us. Here we are on the south summit:
