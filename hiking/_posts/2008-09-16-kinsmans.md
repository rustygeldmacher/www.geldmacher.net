We did get a late start on hiking this season, but we're making up for lost time. Last weekend, a few of us went up to the 'Whites and hiked up past Lonesome Lake and across the Kinsman Ridge to both peaks of Mt. Kinsman.

Though rain was in the forecast, we ended up with a beautiful day. September 13th also happened to be the day that [Flags on the 48](http://www.flagsonthe48.org/) was going on. Basically, what happens is that on the first Saturday after September 11, volunteers hike up to each of the 48 peaks on the [White Mountains 4,000 footer list](http://www.geldmacher.net/4000-footers/) and place an American flag on the summit from noon until 2:00.

It's a pretty nice gesture, as far as honoring those who died that day in 2001. We met some interesting characters involved in the event, and we're even thinking about volunteering to cover a peak next year!
