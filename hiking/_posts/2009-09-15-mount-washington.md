After a few cancellations due to bad weather, we finally got a window of opportunity to hike up [Mt. Washington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Washington_%28New_Hampshire%29) this past weekend. The highest peak in the White Mountains, Washington soars to just about 6300 feet at the summit.

By a "window of opportunity" I mean waiting for weather conditions that wouldn't kill us. Mount Washington is [home to the world's worst weather](http://www.mountwashington.org/), and we didn't want to take that lightly. The day started off very well, with fairly clear skies and a view straight up to the top. However, as the morning turned into afternoon, clouds came through and covered the summit. As a result, we hiked the final two miles to the summit in a thick fog with only a couple hundred feet of visibility. Combined with the wind and drizzle, it was quite an experience.

Hiking Washington is bittersweet -- due to the [auto road](http://www.mountwashingtonautoroad.com/) and [the cog railway](http://www.thecog.com/), the summit is crowded with tourists. It's tough to feel like you've accomplished much when you get to the summit and you're able to use a flush toilet, eat pizza and clam chowder, and buy a t-shirt. On the other hand, knowing you've just climbed the highest peak in the Northeast is a great feeling.

This hike gets us one closer to completing the 48 4,000 footers in the White Mountains. We've only got one left and we plan to do that in the spring or early summer of 2010. Until then, we'll be enjoying some great fall and winter hikes!
