In what was most likely the last hike we'll take this year, [Dan](http://www.littlebigmind.com), his brother Rob and I once again headed up to the White Mountains of New Hampshire to tackle more peaks. This time we hit the peaks of Mount Willey and Mount Field which both lie together on a convenient loop. The hike was fun and the weather largely cooperated. Although the air temperature was around 50 degrees (and around 40 degrees on the peaks), the sun was shining and there was little to no wind. The mountains are a great place in the Fall, and you can see more of it in [the gallery for the hike](http://www.flickr.com/photos/geldmacher/sets/72157594560549263/). Big thanks to Dan for bringing his camera and taking great pictures!

While we're at it, I'll also introduce a new page I recently put together to document my progress bagging the fourty-eight 4000 foot peaks in the White Mountains. Doing this earns "membership" into the [AMC 4000 Footers Club](http://www.amc4000footer.org). This hike will make twelve 4000 footers completed to date, meaning we are a quarter of the way there. Check out [my 4000 Footers Page ](http://www.geldmacher.net/index.php/4000-footers/)for more details.
