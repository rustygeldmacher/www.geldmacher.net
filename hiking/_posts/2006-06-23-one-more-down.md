Another hike, another peak to mark off of my [4,000 footers list](http://www.geldmacher.net/index.php/4000-footers/). Last weekend Dan, Mike, Chris and I went up to New Hampshire and did an overnight hike up Mt. Isolation. We did this hike as a sort of training for next weekend's five day adventure. Yup, over the Fourth of July weekend we plan to traverse a 5-day, 4-night, 12-peak route around the Pemigewassett Wilderness. It will be the event of the summer.

Last night I posted [a gallery of pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/geldmacher/sets/72157594560192694/) from the Mt. Isolation trip. Other recent events include upgrading this site to WordPress 2.0 and creating that new header graphic using the panorama from the top of [Mt. Bond](http://www.flickr.com/photos/geldmacher/sets/72157594561292398/). Not sure how much the upgrade will affect things, but if something seems broken don't hesitate to let me know!
