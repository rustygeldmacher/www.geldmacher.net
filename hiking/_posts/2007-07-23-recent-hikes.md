It just dawned on me that I never posted my two latest hiking trips to this page. They both were done over the July 4th weekend, day hikes amidst four days of camping in [Twin Mountain, NH](http://www.ucampnh.com/ammonoosuc/). We used those hikes to tie up a few loose ends: North Twin, which we missed during our [Pemi Traverse](http://www.geldmacher.net/index.php/2006/07/04/the-big-one/), and Mount Cabot, [which had defeated us](http://www.geldmacher.net/index.php/2007/04/23/tuckermans-ravine/) earlier this year.
