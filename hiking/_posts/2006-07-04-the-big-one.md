Got back yesterday evening from one of the longest, most fun, most physically intense hikes I've done so far. For four days we trekked a thirty mile loop up and down ten mountain peaks in the western half of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. The weather reports mentioned chances of thunderstorms, but since our rule is to hike rain or shine, we went anyway. Well the reports were mostly right, as we got rain on three of the four days we were there. On the first day, as we were descending Mt. Flume, we actually got some hail! But somehow luck was with us -- we only had bad weather on one peak, most of the thunderstorms passed in under and hour, and we got great views for the most important parts of the hike.

I've started making little information pages about each of my hikes. So far, they are all linked to from the mountain names in the [4,000 footers list](http://www.geldmacher.net/index.php/4000-footers/). Each of these pages lists the route that we took, who was there, and has some pictures on it. Some even have a [3D topograph of the hike](http://www.geldmacher.net/galleries/displayimage.php?album=16&pos=0), courtesy of [Dan](http://www.littlebigmind.com) and his GPS.

Oh, and I know I said five days in my previous post, but we actually planned it so we could do the hike in four or five days depending on if we were up for a long (11 mile) walk on the last day. That's what we opted for, so we made it out in four. We skipped North Twin because we wanted to beat the weather to Guyot Campsite, but other than that the hike went exactly as planned. Now I can't wait until our next trip in early August!
