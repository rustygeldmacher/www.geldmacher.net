Late fall is a great time for hiking -- the air is crisp and clear, there are no bugs, it's not oppressively cold, the views are fantastic and it's a great extra challenge. A couple weekends ago, we went up the New Hampshire and hiked up Mt. Tecumseh, which at 4003 feet is the lowest mountain on [the list](http://www.geldmacher.net/index.php/4000-footers/). Don't let that fool you, though: Tecumseh is no joke. It's one of those mountains that starts off nice and steady but rises steeply for about a mile up to the summit. At just over 5 miles round trip, it was great hike to kick off the winter season.

After hitting up Tecumseh, me and G headed up to Maine for a weekend in Camden along the Maine coast. While we were up there we hiked up the highest peak in [Camden Hills State Park](http://www.maine.gov/cgi-bin/doc/parks/find_one_name.pl?park_id=14), Mt. Megunticook. It was a wonderful hike and we got some incredible weather.
