Last weekend we took a trip up to the Whites for some relaxing car camping along with some fairly intense day hiking. A significant milestone was reached by [Dan](http://www.littlebigmind.com) and I -- after bagging another five peaks, we are now over half way done with the [4,000 footers](http://www.geldmacher.net/index.php/4000-footers/). This time, we did a trek up and down [Mt. Carrigain](http://www.geldmacher.net/index.php/mt-carrigain-hike/) on one day, and then a traverse over the [southern end of the Presidential Range](http://www.geldmacher.net/index.php/southern-presidentials-hike/) (Mt. Jackson, Mt. Pierce, Mt. Eisenhower and Mt. Monroe) on another day. For our last hike of the trip, we accompanied Jimmy as he grabbed Mt. Hale (even though we've already done it this year).

We're intending to do at least one more hike this year, probably another day hike to bag a few more peaks. At this rate, there is a good chance of finishing next year, but there's no rush.
