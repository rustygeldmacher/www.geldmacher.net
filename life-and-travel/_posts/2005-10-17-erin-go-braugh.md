For the past few days I've been working on a small project to document the trip I took to Ireland a few years ago. Ever since the trip I've had a ton of pictures sitting on my computer waiting to be categorized, tagged, and captioned. Along with those I had the trip itinerary that I wanted to cross-reference with those pictures and a few comments of my own. Well, I finally got up the motivation to do it and you can now see the results on the following pages:


* [Ireland Trip 2003](http://www.geldmacher.net/index.php/ireland-trip-2003/)


* Go directly to the [Ireland trip photo gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/geldmacher/sets/72157594570197409/)


You can also get there any time by clicking the "Ireland Trip 2003" link on the sidebar.
