  Hi there! I'm glad you took the time to peek at the source for my resume page!
  Here are a few things you might notice:
  * I'm still learning, but I've tried to make use various HTML5 elements and structure when possible
  * The page is laid out using the excellent 960.gs CSS framework
  * All HTML and CSS validates (CSS valid with vendor extensions)

  The visual design was based on a resume template by Things That are Brown

        <h3>Director of Engineering, June 2018 to Present</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All engineering managers report up to me, so this role is basically the lead of the engineering
            management team. As such I'm responsible for the growth and development of all our engineers,
            as well as hiring, on-boarding and performance evaluation.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to increase fairness and consistency in evaluation, I designed and launched Iora Engineering's
            official title ladder, role descriptions, and associated expectations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overhauled engineering's interviewing process to increase objectivity, standardize on focus areas,
            and reduce bias. Additionally, documented and standardized the engineering on-boarding process to
            get people up to speed as quickly as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initiated a process of lightweight, quarterly feedback for all engineers and managers. Created a
            formal goal-setting process between managers and their reports. Formalized the management team and
            helped orient new managers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Senior Staff Engineer, June 2015 to June 2018</h3>

            monitoring, reliability, scalability, and compliance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Revamped and updated the platfom automation suite (Ansible, Packer) to emphasize completeness,
            consistency, reproducability and parity across environments. Introduced immutable machine
            images as best practice, plus the ability to rebuild any part of the system during work hours
            without interruption to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            Introduced comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and metrics collection throughout all environments
            by inplementing Sensu, InfluxDB, and Grafana.
          </li>
          <li>
            Helped to organize the development group into cohesive teams using an agile process to reduce
            WIP, make work visible, and perform regular retrospectives. This served as a starting point
            for evolving the way work is done at the company.
