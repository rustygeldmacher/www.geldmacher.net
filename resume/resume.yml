  roles:
  - role: SDE III (L6 Senior SDE)
    start: 2023-02
    highlights:
    - Leading an effort to break down One Medical's Ruby on Rails monolith into smaller domain services.
      We are starting with a subset of
      functionality all owned by a specific sub-organization. The team is working to solve extraction issues
      such as maintaining data consistency and safely being able to switch over to the new service without
      down time.
    - Created a working group called "Future of the Monolith" to help determine what to do with One Medical's
      central technology service. Successfully lead an effort to fully modularize the nearly 1M line of code
      Ruby service using [Packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk). Completed the effort by determining
      team-based ownership assignments for each module, thereby obtaining 100% code ownership in the monolith.
    - Coordinated campaigns to help clean up and address technical debt in the code base. These included removing
      unused API end points, removing unused classes and rake tasks, and removing all last usage of deprecated
      v1 APIs in order to clean those out of the code!
    - Lead the project to get One Medical's Ruby on Rails monolith through the Amazon security review process.
      At the time, it was the largest single security review that Amazon acquisitions security had ever done.

  summary: >
    As Engineering Director, I led the engineering management team, established structured career development
    frameworks including a title ladder and competency matrix, standardized hiring and onboarding processes,
    and implemented quarterly feedback systems. Concurrently serving as Platform Architect, I provided technical
    leadership for our cloud platform technology, guiding the team through modernization efforts including
    containerization and managed services. I began at Iora as a Senior Staff Engineer, where I developed features
    for our EHR system, created a dedicated platform team, revamped cloud automation for consistency and reliability,
    implemented comprehensive monitoring systems, and helped organize development into agile teams to improve
    workflow and visibility.
  roles:
  - role: Director of Engineering
    start: 2018-06
    end: 2021-09
    highlights:
    - As the lead of the engineering management team, all engineering managers report up to me.
      In this role I'm responsible for putting process in place to support the growth and development
      of all our engineers, as well as hiring, on-boarding, performance evaluation, and ensuring
      consistent management practices.
    - In order to increase fairness and consistency in evaluation, I designed and launched Iora Engineering's
      official title ladder, role descriptions, competency matrix, and associated expectations.
    - Overhauled engineering's interviewing process to increase objectivity, standardize on focus areas,
      and reduce bias. Documented and standardized the engineering on-boarding process to
      get people up to speed as quickly as possible.
    - Initiated a process of lightweight, quarterly feedback for all engineers and managers. Created a
      formal goal-setting process between managers and their reports. Formalized the management team and
      helped orient new managers.
  - role: Platform Architect
    start: 2019-06
    end: 2021-09
    highlights:
    - In addition to my role as engineering director, I also serve as the architect and owner of
      Iora's cloud platform technology and associated roadmap.
    - As the platform "product owner" I guide the platform team by setting architectural goals and
      priorities, breaking down work into valuable deliverables, and keeping the team on track to
      complete projects.
    - Some of the efforts I've guided the platform team through include moving to more third-party
      managed services, moving workloads into containers, creating a dedicated platform on-call
      rotation, and increasing visibility into system performance.
  - role: Senior Staff Engineer
    start: 2015-06
    end: 2018-06
    highlights:
    - Began in 2015 as an application developer building features in Iora's Electronic Health
      Records system called Chirp (Ruby on Rails SOA backed, Backbone frontend). Helped move
      the frontend from Backbone to EmberJS. Implemented many user-facing features, Rails-based
      APIs, and backend business processes.
    - In 2016 I helped create, then joined Iora's platform team responsible for all aspects of cloud operations,
      monitoring, reliability, scalability, and compliance.
    - Revamped and updated the platform automation suite (Ansible, Packer) to emphasize completeness,
      consistency, reproducibility and parity across environments. Introduced immutable machine
      images as best practice, plus the ability to rebuild any part of the system during work hours
      without interruption to the user.
    - Introduced comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and metrics collection throughout all environments
      by implementing Sensu, InfluxDB, and Grafana.
    - Helped to organize the development group into cohesive teams using an agile process to reduce
      WIP, make work visible, and perform regular retrospectives. This served as a starting point
      for evolving the way work is done at the company.

cover_letter:
- If I had to sum up what I bring to an organization it's this -- I solve problems. I look for
  the bottleneck and I relentlessly pursue breaking it. What's preventing us from quickly and
  safely delivering user value? That's where I tend to focus my energies.
- Much of my recent experience has been in the areas of developer ergonomics, operational
  excellence, and systems/processes for safe software development. This is mostly because in my
  recent environments, those were the problem areas that needed to be addressed. I am equally
  happy to be developing valuable functionality for end users.
- My career has included the contributor/manager pendulum swing. I've been both a front-line
  manager and manager-of-managers, and I moved back to being an IC in mid-2023. I treasure my
  experience as a manager, and I've used everything I learned in my work as a high-level IC.
  Even though at the moment being an IC is what makes me happiest, I would not rule out moving
  back into a management position in the future.
- As you can see from my resume, I'm adaptable to a variety of technologies. In my career I have
  done everything from low-level assembly & C, to Java, C#, and finally Ruby. I love Ruby, but
  you can see from my track record that technology choice isn't the first consideration. At this
  point in my career I have the skills and confidence to be able to quickly ramp up on any tech
  stack that I need to.
