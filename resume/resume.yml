      as well as hiring, on-boarding and performance evaluation.
    - In order to increase fairness and consistency in evaluation, I designed and launched Iora Engineering's
      official title ladder, role descriptions, and associated expectations.
    - Overhauled engineering's interviewing process to increase objectivity, standardize on focus areas,
      and reduce bias. Additionally, documented and standardized the engineering on-boarding process to
      get people up to speed as quickly as possible.
    - Initiated a process of lightweight, quarterly feedback for all engineers and managers. Created a
      formal goal-setting process between managers and their reports. Formalized the management team and

      consistency, reproducibility and parity across environments. Introduced immutable machine
      images as best practice, plus the ability to rebuild any part of the system during work hours
      without interruption to the user.
    - Introduced comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and metrics collection throughout all environments
      by implementing Sensu, InfluxDB, and Grafana.
    - Helped to organize the development group into cohesive teams using an agile process to reduce
      WIP, make work visible, and perform regular retrospectives. This served as a starting point
      for evolving the way work is done at the company.
