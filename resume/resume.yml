  roles:
  - role: Director of Engineering
    start: 2018-06
    highlights:
    - As the lead of the engineering management team, all engineering managers report up to me.
      In this role I'm responsible for putting process in place to support the growth and development
      of all our engineers, as well as hiring, on-boarding, performance evaluation, and ensuring
      consistent mangement practices.
    - In order to increase fairness and consistency in evaluation, I designed and launched Iora Engineering's
      official title ladder, role descriptions, competency matrix, and associated expectations.
    - Overhauled engineering's interviewing process to increase objectivity, standardize on focus areas,
      and reduce bias. Documented and standardized the engineering on-boarding process to
      get people up to speed as quickly as possible.
    - Initiated a process of lightweight, quarterly feedback for all engineers and managers. Created a
      formal goal-setting process between managers and their reports. Formalized the management team and
      helped orient new managers.
  - role: Platform Architect
    start: 2019-06
    highlights:
    - In addition to my role as engineering director, I also serve as the architect and owner of
      Iora's cloud platform technology and associated roadmap.
    - As the platform "product owner" I guide the platform team by setting architectural goals and
      priorities, breaking down work into valuable deliverables, and keeping the team on track to
      complete projects.
    - Some of the efforts I've guided the platform team through include moving to more third-party
      managed services, moving workloads into containers, creating a dedicated platform on-call
      rotation, and increasing visibility into system performance.
  - role: Senior Staff Engineer
    start: 2015-06
    end: 2018-06
    highlights:
    - Began in 2015 as an application developer building features in Iora's Electronic Health
      Records system called Chirp (Ruby on Rails SOA backed, Backbone frontend). Helped move
      the frontend from Backbone to EmberJS. Implemented many user-facing features, Rails-based
      APIs, and backend business processes.
    - In 2016 I helped create, then joined Iora's platform team responsible for all aspects of cloud operations,
      monitoring, reliability, scalability, and compliance.
    - Revamped and updated the platform automation suite (Ansible, Packer) to emphasize completeness,
      consistency, reproducibility and parity across environments. Introduced immutable machine
      images as best practice, plus the ability to rebuild any part of the system during work hours
      without interruption to the user.
    - Introduced comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and metrics collection throughout all environments
      by implementing Sensu, InfluxDB, and Grafana.
    - Helped to organize the development group into cohesive teams using an agile process to reduce
      WIP, make work visible, and perform regular retrospectives. This served as a starting point
      for evolving the way work is done at the company.
