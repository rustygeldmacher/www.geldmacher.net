    notes:
    - Would use a little less sugar next time but they are delicious.
    - Like the recipe comments suggested, I threw a few fresh dill fronds into the jar.
    - Gave them about two days in the fridge before trying them.

    - Halved the recipe, but used only 2/3 the amount of sugar called for (so in the
      case of halving the recipe, used 1/2 cup of sugar total)
    - Gave them a week in the fridge before trying them

    - Didn't have pickling salt, so I used fine sea salt w.o. additives

    notes:
    - Used a frozen, gluten-free pie crust left out for about 15 minutes before cooking
    - Used 5oz spinach (pre-cooked), 1.5 oz shredded cheddar, 3.5 oz ham
    - Should have squeezed out the spinach a little bit more
    - Cooked exactly 45 minutes

    notes:
    - Used caramel (4), chocolate sauce (2) and apricot-raspberry preserves (2) for the
      various toppings. Caramel was the clear winner.
    - Didn't catch this in the recipe, but probably should have popped them all into the
      fridge for a bit before serving, because the cooled ones were way better than the
      slightly warm ones we first ate.

    notes:
    - Made two 2-cup batches (one third of the recipe) but used gluten free AP flour for one
      of them.
    - Probably needed to increase the amount of baking powder in the gluten free one to get
      a better rise.
    - Thinned out the non-gluten-free batter a little with 2-3 tablespoons of milk.

    notes:
    - Gemma didn't think so, but I thought it was a tad too lemony. Next time, I want to
      try half the lemon juice (perhaps add a bt more cream instead?)

    notes:
    - The recipe wasn't super exact about quantities (I wish I weighed them) but I used
      a tablespoon of each herb coarsely chopped, and approximately one ounce of chives.
      I think it could have used a touch more of each, but was still really good.

    ease: 5
    notes:
    - Made just one stick worth, used 4 tsp honey and 1/8 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon
    - Didn't use a mixer either -- just mixed it in a bowl with a fork until everything was
      smooth and combined.

    ease: 2
    notes:
    - I think I burned the bacon fat a little bit, so there were chunks in the beans, which
      tasted fine but made for a strange consistency. Next time I think I would render the
      bacon the way I do for chowder -- by adding a quarter cup of water to the pan with the
      bacon and letting it cook off to render.
    - Cooked for about 6 hours, but at five hours I checked them and decided I needed to add
      more liquid -- so I heated up and added a little less than a cup more of vegetable broth.

    - Was hard to get the proportions right. Wish the recipe had amounts instead of
      "one lemon" or "handful of parsley"

    - Did 7 minutes for 3 eggs, which left the yolks only a bit runny. We like runnier
      yolks than that so next time I might try 5 or 6 minutes.

    notes:
    - Should have included some kind of sauce with this, maybe the beurre blanc would have
      been good? Or some kind of gravy. Ended up dipping the tofu in a little hoisin sauce
      that we had in the fridge.

    notes:
    - Used a pre-made Oreo pie crust
    - Was good, but next time I'd replace the Kaluha with something else, perhaps coffee or
      espresso -- there is a kind of background alcohol "burn" to the pie's taste that we
      don't like, but otherwise the texture and chocolate flavor is great.

    - Can't see the rhyme or reason behind this recipe. Swing and a miss I think.
