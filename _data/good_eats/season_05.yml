    notes:
    - Might try reducing the amount of gelatin by ~25% next time
    - Cranberry glaze took a long time to set up -- do it early, keep it at room temp
    - Could probably put some plastic wrap on top while it sets to help avoid "skin"

    notes:
    - Didn't stir as much as the recipe said to -- only stirred 3 times or so over the course of the
      hour and a half cooking time
    - This makes a TON of granola

    notes:
    - Quiches took 25m to set rather than 15m the recipe says

    ease: 2
    notes:
    - Used a 2.5lb pork belly, and halved the amounts in the wet cure
    - Next time time would flip the belly and put the bottom of the belly up to dry with the
      fan and develop a pellicle
    - Smoked it on a grill with a smoke tube, got about 2hrs of smoke per full tube. Smoked
      for a total of about 6 hours, which I think was plenty.

    - Used a medium-sized eggplant
    - Used only a handful of parsley
    - For that sized eggplant, might want to use just one clove of fresh garlic.

    notes:
    - Scraped the inside of the squid bodies, like he did in the episode
    - Didn't have a wok, so just did this in a regular frying pan over the hottest
      heat my stove could go
    - Five rating based mostly on the fact that it's a great general stir-fry, which
      would be great with shrimp, chicken, etc.

    notes:
    - Squash took an hour and 15m to cook (vs recipe saying ~35m)

    notes:
    - Tossed a tablespoon of butter into the rendered salt pork fat
    - Recipe used way too many potatoes. I used a little more than four cups,
      which is 3 medium sized russets. Would recommend no more than 2 russets.
    - Ended up probably using 3 cups of milk instead of the two called for in the recipe.
      Otherwise, there wouldn't have been enough to cook the potatoes.
