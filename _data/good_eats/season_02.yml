    crowd: 2
    ease: 2
    notes:
    - I only have an 8-inch loaf pan so I used the remaining batter in muffin tins. If
      I were going to do this again, I'd make them all muffins.
    - This was the only time I've had fruitcake, and probably will be the last.

    notes:
    - Turned out stringy and clumpy, congealed really fast.
    - Served with summer sausage, blanched broccoli, bread chunks, and roasted
      baby potatoes.

    crowd: 4
    ease: 2
    notes:
    - Used a loaf of rustic sourdough and some 3 year aged cheddar.
    - The dijon added a nice twang to the sandwich. It probably won't become my go-to
      grilled cheese method, but I'll probably do it again when I feel like changing
      things up.
    - Gave this a 2 for ease because practically, I won't really do grilled cheese using
      this method again. It was fun, though.

    crowd: 3
    ease: 3
    notes:
    - Next time would probably go a little easier on the curry powder and leave out the
      red onions. The recipe makes a salad with a little more kick than the crowd would prefer.

    ease: 4
    notes:
    - Before hitting it with the immersion blender I poured off all the liquid. Once I started
      blending, I poured the liquid into the bowl to help blend. This got me a great sauce
      consistency and I think had I left all the liquid in, it would have been more like a
      soup than a sauce.

    notes:
    - Used Fuji apples and it turned out great
    - Next time would want to try peeling each apple in "stripes" every few inches
    - Served over ice cream, but need to remember to let them cool a bit more before
      serving.

    crowd: 5
    ease: 2
    notes:
    - Used only a 1/4 of corn meal, and an extra 1/4 cup of flour
    - Instead of apple juice concentrate, I used diluted apple cider. Needed to add a
      lot more liquid than the recipe seemed to call for, but I got a decent crust
      consistency anyway.
    - Used a frozen Sarah Lee pound cake.

    notes:
    - This was good, but a little on the spicy side. Next time will probably leave out
      the red pepper and chili powder.

    crowd: 4
    ease: 3
    notes:
    - Some of the burgers were amazing, other had a ton of gristle. Next time I need to be
      way more careful cutting up the steaks so I don't keep anything that would turn to
      gristle as the burgers cooked.
    - Probably will add more than just salt to the burger mix next time, too. I like the
      "steak burger" flavor but I also like burgers with more in the mix.

    notes:
    - Used Samuel Adams Boston Lager for the batter. I used a whole 12oz bottle at first,
      then put it in the fridge fo almost an hour. After taking it out of the fridge I
      put in another half bottle or so. The batter was a great consistency.

    notes:
    - Left out the star anise because we didn't have any, I couldn't find any at the three
      local markets, and most of all I'm not crazy about it to begin with.

    crowd: 4
    ease: 3
    notes:
    - Used a stick blender to make give it a consistency of a thicker jarred sauce, rather than
      leaving a lot of chunks.
    - Would like to try this without broiling the tomatoes.

    notes:
    - Made a few substitutions in the rub -- paprika for chili powder, chili powder for cayenne,
      and garlic powder for jalapeno seasoning.
    - Could have probably cooked them for another half hour or so

    - A good method to pop loose kernels in the microwave
