      usually do steaks.

    - Would rarely think of doing baked potatoes, but they were great
    - An hour plus cooking, though, means they'll probably stay a rarity

    - Used 7 Yukon Golds but could have used a bunch more -- in the seven there were
      some smaller ones and medium ones. Next time I'll make sure to weigh them and
      note that down.
    - The market only had one portobello cap so I used some chopped baby bellas and
      it was still great.

    - Really liked these. Using both russets and red potatoes is a great move.
    - Not our all-time-favorite mashed but they were up there. I don't usually have
      buttermilk on hand but this is a good use for it.

    - First time using a double-boiler!
    - I used 2 large lemons in this, got more than 1/3 cup of juice and plenty of zest. If
      I did this again I'd measure the zest because it was plenty.

    notes:
    - No crowd this time, just for my own lunch.
    - AB says to cook only until there's no more liquid in the pan, then transfer
      to the plate. To me, that leaves the eggs a little too runny for my taste.
      I usually cook them a little bit longer, which I like better, so that's why
      I gave this a 3 out of 5.

    crowd: 3
    ease: 3
    notes:
    - The recipe calls for a 3-4 pound chicken, but the smallest I could get
      was a 5 pounder. The chicken came out really moist and tender, however
      I had to add an extra 20-25 minutes to the cook time to get it to temp.
      That's expected, because the recipe is for a smaller bird.
    - We think it would have been much better if it used way less pepper. It
      came out so peppery that I had to wash off my daughter's portion.
    - AB says that the veggies give all they had during cooking but we ate
      the carrots anyway -- they weren't bad!
    - The jus was fantastic! Next time I will turn it into a gravy.

    notes:
    - This ice cream was so incredibly tasty, the tiny touch of peach flavor is an
      awesome addition.
    - Found out later that in the episode AB added a pinch of kosher salt, which I
      didn't do here. Would like to give a shot next time.

    - Biscuits were more "cakey" than "flakey" but that's fine -- I think that's the
      intention for this recipe anyway.
    - They are SO good, even the GF ones are fantastic.

    - These might have been a bit easier than the biscuits because you don't need to
      roll them out on the counter -- you can go right from the bowl to the sheet pan.
    - Gemma gave them a 5

    - Followed the recipe and added 2 tablespoons of the roux, but seemed to thicken it

      though really delicious anyway.

      was just as good as gluten flour.

    - Used 5lb of onions total -- 3 pounds of Vidalia and 2 pounds of reds.
    - Cutting up 5lb of onions is a terrible job, and I'd recommend that folks trying this
      recipe cut them before anyone else is around. People near the kitchen were all
      having a tough time of it.
    - Topped w/ shredded gruyere.
    - Skipped the cognac, though I'm not sure it made a difference. The soup was still
      amazing!

    - These were fantastic, would definitely make them again.
    - Did the spice mix like in the show for Gemma and me, and just salt for Vivian.
      Both variations were a hit.
    - Preparation was a pain though -- the steaks had a ton of pin bones and try as I might
      I couldn't get them all. Tying them was a bit tricky, had do do a couple twice before
      they held together.
